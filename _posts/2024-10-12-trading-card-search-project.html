<p>A project I recently worked on with my brother. This is all based on the assumption that there are some baseball or football cards on mercari that are underpriced compared to the rest of the market. The cards title, pricing, and image would be sourced from mercari and then compared to recently sold cards on eBay. This sounded simple enough and I was fine throwing a few hundered dollars at undervalued cards in exchange for an interesting story and a potential profitable venture.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Attempt to use an already existing card search API</h2>


<p>Initially I tried to deconstruct Ludex API so I can run the mercari images through there. The problem I ran into with Ludex was that I didn't know where the hell they are getting the card ID from. I had all of the routes, from sign in to making a card search request. All of it made sense except for the card ID which appeared once in this whole process and it was coming from the client side. I tried making a fake card ID with the same format, I even tried to re-install the app because I wanted to rule out a thought I had that they must have been sending a batch of unassigned card ID's every now &amp; then as a security measure. You know, in case someone tries to deconstruct their API and not use it for their intended purpose. I wonder who would do that.</p>


<p>Anyway, the longer I spent on this search for where the mysterious Card ID came from, the crazier my ideas gotten. I decided to quit when my theory devolved into a cicadia 3301 esque idea that the card ID must have been coming from possibly a combination of one or more of the following things shoved into some type of cryptographic function: A timestamp, the image being searched, some account attribute.</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Card search pivot to use eBay image search</h2>


<p>I then briefly looked at 130point but then settled on using Ebay image API to search for already listed cards since I don't have to worry nearly as much about rate limiting or randomly getting my account cancelled for API's that aren't intended for developers (with the exception of mercari). Of course there's still a rate limit but its much more generous.</p>


<p>Unfortunately eBay doesn't have an image search for sold products but this was something I was okay with since I just wanted to complete this project and move on to something more important. Here is what the end product looks like</p>

<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>[ Mercari search (image, post title, price) ]
              |
              v
[ Ebay image search API (image, title, price) ]
              |
              v
[ Claude API (prompt, post title, price) ]</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>

<p>I'll make the code public on my github when I get the chance but over time, ill keep updating this post with the results as I find them. At least until I use all of the $25 in credits that I gave claude</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">
<br>The end result</h2>


<p>In practice we haven't found many cards that this ended up appearing as a clear buy. I don't trade cards so I was relying on my brothers opinion on the results. To me, the problem with baseball cards is that it sounds like the market is thinly traded. Football cards are better but there's only a few years that are okay to look at for them</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the value of the 2014 Bowman Chrome Prospects Mookie Betts RED WAVE REFRACTOR /25 PSA 10 card. This is a highly valuable card due to several factors:</p>
<p>1. It's a Mookie Betts rookie card from 2014<br />
2. It's a rare Red Wave Refractor, numbered to only 25<br />
3. It's graded PSA 10, which is the highest grade<br />
4. The population (POP) is only 3, making it extremely scarce</p>
<p>Comparing to similar cards in the list:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/395602819403?hash=item5c1bc3f94b:g:6-wAAOSweJxmwZWK">2014 Bowman Prospects Mookie Betts Chrome-Blue Wave Refractor PSA 10</a> is priced at $900. However, the Red Wave is rarer than the Blue Wave.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/186076477459?hash=item2b5305b813:g:BQ0AAOSwt1RlAHVa">2014 1st Bowman SILVER ICE PSA 10 GEM MINT Pop 5</a> is priced at $2,799.99. This is a good comparison, but the Red Wave /25 is likely more valuable.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/256624771993?hash=item3bc0074399:g:gtIAAOSwdUVm1V80">2014 Bowman Chrome 1st Mookie Betts PSA 10 Gem</a> is priced at $225, but this is likely a base version, not a rare parallel.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/285402559426?hash=item42735173c2:g:EikAAOSwNNllA~t3">2014 Mookie Betts Rookie Bowman Chrome Bgs 9.5 RC Orange Wave Refractor</a> is priced at $849, but it's a lower grade and possibly a less rare parallel.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the value of the 2014 Bowman Chrome Prospects Mookie Betts RED WAVE REFRACTOR /25 PSA 10 to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000, possibly even higher due to its rarity and perfect grade.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of the 2020 Panini Donruss Justin Herbert Gem MT PSA 10 Rookie RC Chargers card.</p>
<p>The key factors to consider are:<br />
1. It's a Justin Herbert rookie card<br />
2. It's from the 2020 Panini Donruss set<br />
3. It's graded PSA 10 (Gem Mint condition)</p>
<p>Looking at the comparable cards in the COMPARE_ARRAY, we can see several relevant listings:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304354306669?hash=item46dcee2a6d:g:4JgAAOSwvBhiByFz">2020 Panini Donruss Justin Herbert LA Chargers RATED ROOKIE CARD No.303 *PSA 10*</a> priced at $199.99<br />

<p>These listings are the most relevant as they match the year, set, player, and PSA 10 grade of the card in question. The prices for these cards range from $194.00 to $209.99.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Donruss Justin Herbert Gem MT PSA 10 Rookie RC Chargers card to be between $190 and $210.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of the Jalen Hurts 2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance #210 Rookie RC PSA 10 Gem Mint card.</p>
<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, I estimate the fair value of this card to be between $40 and $50. Here's my reasoning:</p>
<p>1. The exact match to our card, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/115925271087?hash=item1afdaf422f:g:um0AAOSwNuxlEk3Z">JALEN HURTS ~ 2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance #210 Rookie RC ~ PSA 10 Gem Mint</a>, is priced at $44.99.</p>
<p>2. Several other identical or very similar cards are priced in this range:<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/394934959386?hash=item5bf3f53d1a:g:GeUAAOSw4l5lKeMN">2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance Jalen Hurts Rookie RC #210 PSA 10</a> at $45.00<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/126075376845?hash=item1d5aad94cd:g:ljEAAOSwXFxk8ija">2020 Panini Chronicles Jalen Hurts Teal Luminance PSA 10 Eagles QB RC</a> at $44.99<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/155455607190?hash=item2431e05196:g:phkAAOSw435kEeD-">2020 Panini Chronicles Jalen Hurts Luminance PINK ROOKIE #210 PSA 10 GEM MINT 💎</a> at $49.99<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/364190106666?hash=item54cb6c042a:g:~2kAAOSwgHNkGhFh">JALEN HURTS 2020 CHRONICLES LUMINANCE ROOKIE RC #210 PSA 10 GEM MINT! EAGLES NFL</a> at $49.99</p>
<p>3. There are a few listings priced higher, such as <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/156150123947?hash=item245b45cdab:g:NxUAAOSwHxpmDI1A">2020 Panini Chronicles - Luminance #210 Jalen Hurts Rookie RC Gem Mint PSA 10</a> at $60.00, but these seem to be outliers.</p>
<p>4. Some variants like the Bronze version or Teal SP are priced higher, but these are not directly comparable to the standard version.</p>
<p>5. There are also some lower-priced options, but many of these are either ungraded or graded by less recognized companies.</p>
<p>Considering all these factors, I believe a fair estimate for this card's value is around $45, which is consistent with several of the listings and represents a middle ground in the observed price range.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 'Colson Montgomery Auto Card'.</p>
<p>Looking at the relevant listings, we have:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/156431039414?hash=item246c043bb6:g:IOEAAOSwKVlm92gL">Colson Montgomery Autographed Card /5</a> priced at $250.00<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/156431047219?hash=item246c045a33:g:IwUAAOSwrX9m92se">Colson Montgomery State Pride Auto Card /4</a> priced at $300.00<br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/235707332094?hash=item36e14075fe:g:BDQAAOSwBTNmxkDV">2021 Leaf Metal Draft State Pride 1/1 Colson Montgomery #SP-CM2 Auto</a> priced at $185.99<br />
4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/256346032887?hash=item3baf6a0af7:g:TKoAAOSwEfNlbR4f">COLSON MONTGOMERY 2021 LEAF METAL DRAFT STATE PRIDE CRYSTAL AUTO #SP-CM2</a> priced at $31.99</p>
<p>The prices vary significantly, likely due to factors such as rarity (e.g., /5 or /4 indicating limited prints), condition, and specific card features (like "State Pride" or "Crystal").</p>
<p>Without knowing the exact details of the card in question (such as its rarity, set, or condition), I would estimate the fair value to be in the range of $100 to $250. This takes into account the lower-priced listings while also considering the potential for higher value if it's a rarer card.</p>
<p>For the purposes of setting PRICE_RESPONSE, I'll use the lower end of this range:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=100</p>
<p>This estimate assumes an average condition and non-limited print run. If the card is particularly rare, in mint condition, or from a highly sought-after set, its value could be higher. Conversely, if it's from a less desirable set or in poor condition, it might be worth less.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the Tua Tagovailoa card. While there aren't many exact matches for this specific card in the given list, we can use similar high-end football cards as a reference point.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/256555537312?var=556795659227&amp;hash=item3bbbe6d3a0:g:bWcAAOSwLrlmfQdH">2021 Panini Flawless Collegiate /25 Dak Prescott #102</a> priced at $180.50<br />

<p>The Tua Tagovailoa card is from the 2020 Flawless College set, which is a high-end product. It's an autographed rookie patch card numbered to 25, which adds significant value. Tua Tagovailoa is also a more prominent player than Cornell Powell, but perhaps not quite as established as Dak Prescott or Tyreek Hill at this point.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Tua Tagovailoa card to be in the range of $250 to $350. The lower end of this range takes into account that Tua is a newer player compared to Prescott or Hill, while the upper end reflects the desirability of his rookie cards and the limited nature of the card.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "2020 Panini Illusions Jordan Love 2-color jersey #10/10 rookie auto, PSA pop 1" card. This card is particularly rare and valuable due to its low print run (10/10), rookie status, autograph, and jersey patch.</p>
<p>Comparing it to similar cards in the COMPARE_ARRAY:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/176549086568?hash=item291b254568:g:NPYAAOSwShpm0L69">2020 Illusions Jordan Love Red First Impressions RC Patch Auto RPA 61/99-Packers</a> is priced at $400.00, but has a higher print run (61/99).</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/364867214266?hash=item54f3c7dbba:g:CagAAOSwnC1mL9b8">2020 Jordan Love Panini Illusions First Impressions #104 RC RPA Auto /199 GEM 10</a> is priced at $499.00, but has an even higher print run (/199).</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/355930252860?hash=item52df18a63c:g:~fcAAOSw7DNmsaMt">Jordan Love 2020 illusions first impressions jersey auto autograph #32/50</a> is priced at $340.00, with a print run of /50.</p>
<p>Considering the rarity of the card in question (10/10) and its PSA pop 1 status, it should be valued significantly higher than these comparable cards. Other high-end rookies in the set, like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/234512522290?hash=item369a091c32:g:rNgAAOSwiP1hFdRY">2020 Panini Illusions Joe Burrow RC RED Rookie Patch Auto /35 PSA 10 POP 1</a> priced at $2499.99, provide a ceiling for the value.</p>
<p>Given these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Jordan Love card to be in the range of $1500 to $2000. The lower end of this range takes into account that Jordan Love, while a promising quarterback, has not yet achieved the same level of success or popularity as some other rookies from that year.</p>

<p>While there isn't an exact match for this card in the comparison list, we can use similar cards featuring Tua Tagovailoa and other high-end products to estimate its value.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons are:</p>

<p>The card in question is from the high-end Immaculate Collegiate set, which typically commands premium prices. It has a PSA 9 grade for the card and a perfect PSA 10 for the autograph, which adds significant value.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the "2020 Immaculate Collegiate Tua Tagovailoa Autograph PSA 9 Auto 10" to be in the range of $800 to $1200.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=800</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the high-end nature of the Immaculate Collegiate product, the dual PSA grades (9 for the card, 10 for the auto), and the prices of comparable Tua Tagovailoa autographed cards from the same era. The lower end of the range ($800) is set as the PRICE_RESPONSE, as requested.

                        Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the relevant football cards and provide an estimate for the Justin Herbert rookie card mentioned in the PRODUCT_TITLE.</p>

<p>The card in question is described as a rare 1/1 Justin Herbert rookie signed card with a MINT 9 grade and Auto 10 grade. This makes it a highly valuable and unique item.</p>
<p>Considering the following factors:<br />
1. It's a 1/1 card, which significantly increases its value<br />
2. It's signed by Justin Herbert<br />
3. It has high grades (MINT 9 for the card, 10 for the autograph)<br />
4. Justin Herbert is a rising star quarterback</p>
<p>The value of this card is likely to be higher than the comparable cards listed. The 1/1 aspect alone puts it above the /15 cards in value. However, the slightly lower card grade (MINT 9 vs PSA 10) may offset this somewhat.</p>
<p>Given these factors, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be in the range of $1,000 to $1,500. The lower end of this range takes into account the slightly lower card grade, while the upper end reflects the 1/1 rarity and high autograph grade.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the PRODUCT_TITLE and compare it with the relevant cards in the COMPARE_ARRAY to estimate a fair value for the Justin Jefferson card.</p>
<p>The product in question is a 2020 Prizm Draft Picks Football Justin Jefferson Rookie Silver Autograph card graded CSG 10. Justin Jefferson is a highly sought-after player, and this is a premium rookie card with an autograph and a high grade.</p>
<p>Looking at comparable cards in the list:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266092414843?hash=item3df458077b:g:xVsAAOSwSbBjyW5l">2020 PANINI MOSAIC J.K. DOBBINS ROOKIE SCRIPTS AUTO PRIZM CSG 10 GEM MINT</a> is priced at $100. While this is a similar product (rookie auto, CSG 10), Dobbins is not as valuable as Jefferson.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/324677456631?hash=item4b9848d2f7:g:Jd8AAOSw-0dgx7Cg">2020 Prizm Draft Justin Herbert #102 RC Auto Neon Orange /99 PSA Mint 9</a> is priced at $749. Herbert is a comparable star quarterback, but this card is numbered to 99 and graded PSA 9, not 10.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/176553960530?hash=item291b6fa452:g:8FsAAOSwe~Vm1PEW">2020 PANINI PRIZM DP AUTO PRIZMS RED/WHITE/BLUE JUSTIN HERBERT /75 BGS 9.5/10</a> is priced at $750. This is another Herbert card, numbered to 75, with a high grade.</p>
<p>Considering these comparables and the fact that Justin Jefferson is one of the top wide receivers in the NFL, I would estimate the value of the Justin Jefferson card to be in the range of $600-$800. The silver prizm and CSG 10 grade add significant value, and Jefferson's popularity among collectors is high.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I can offer an estimate for the value of the Chase Young 2022-21 Absolute Football Rookie Kaboom PSA 10 card. </p>
<p>The most relevant comparison in the list is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/235229289656?hash=item36c4c21cb8:g:9i8AAOSwlfJlFEq5">Chase Young 2022-21 Absolute Football Rookie Kaboom 💥 PSA 10!!

<p>Other relevant comparisons include:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/235776576128?hash=item36e5610a80:g:Vl4AAOSw4F5nBItZ">2020 Chase Young Rookie Kaboom BGS 9</a> priced at $350.00, but this is graded lower at BGS 9 instead of PSA 10.</p>
<p>2. Other rookie Kaboom cards from the same era, such as:<br />

<p>While these are priced lower, they are graded PSA 9 instead of PSA 10, and Chase Young was a higher-profile rookie.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Chase Young 2022-21 Absolute Football Rookie Kaboom PSA 10 to be in the range of $1,200 to $1,400. The lower end of this range takes into account potential market fluctuations and the possibility that the listed price might be slightly high.</p>

<p>These cards are all the same or very similar to the card in question, all being 2020 Donruss Optic Holo Justin Herbert Rated Rookie cards graded PSA 10.</p>
<p>The prices for these comparable cards range from $250 to $999, with most falling between $350 and $500. The $999 price seems to be an outlier, possibly due to additional factors not mentioned in the title.</p>
<p>Considering these comparable sales, I would estimate the fair value of the card to be in the range of $350 to $450. The lower end of this range would be a conservative estimate, while the higher end represents a more optimistic valuation.</p>

<p>After analyzing the comparable cards, I would estimate the value of this card to be between $160 and $245. Here's my reasoning:</p>
<p>1. The most relevant comparisons are other PSA 10 graded Field Level cards of Tua Tagovailoa from the 2020 Panini Select set.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/256173481020?hash=item3ba5211c3c:g:E1IAAOSwq6Nk0Rzr">Tua Tagovailoa Field Level RC PSA 10!! 2020 Panini Select #345 GEM MT Rookie</a> is priced at $160.00, which is a very close match to the card in question.</p>

<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/394953951614?hash=item5bf517097e:g:BdwAAOSwYf1lNsQ-">2020 Panini Select Tua Tagovailoa Field Level Silver Prizm Rookie RC #345 PSA 10</a> is priced at $220.00, which falls between the two previous examples.</p>
<p>5. There are other PSA 10 Tua Tagovailoa cards from this set priced lower, but they may not be the exact Field Level variant or might be less desirable versions.</p>
<p>Given these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of the card to be around $160 at the lower end, potentially reaching up to $245 for the right buyer or if it's a more desirable variant (like Silver Prizm).</p>

<p>The most relevant comparison in the list is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/166997510214?hash=item26e1d3c846:g:YYUAAOSwfphm-g9s">Justin Herbert 2020 Rookie Select Prizm PSA 10 GEM MINT 💎 #144 Chargers</a>, which is priced at $89.99.

<p>Other relevant comparisons, although not exact matches, include:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225297548591?hash=item3474c7c52f:g:HggAAOSw9uxjmKsJ">2020 PANINI SELECT 261 JUSTIN JEFFERSON DIE-CUT RED PRIZM SP PSA 10 RC 🔥 28</a> priced at $149.99<br />

<p>These cards are from the same year and product line (Panini Select), are also rookies, and have the same PSA 10 grade. However, Justin Herbert is generally considered a more valuable player than Justin Jefferson or Tua Tagovailoa, especially for rookie cards.</p>
<p>Considering that our card is specified as "Premier Level," which is typically more desirable than the base level, we can estimate that it would be valued higher than the $89.99 price of the similar Herbert card.</p>
<p>Given these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Select #144 Justin Herbert RC Premier Level PSA 10 Gem Mint Chargers card to be in the range of $120 to $150.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the relevant football cards and provide an estimate for the AJ Dillon rookie autographed blue crystals PSA grade 9 Mint Numbered 8 of 10 card.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/324263657114?hash=item4b7f9ebe9a:g:44sAAOSw0F9fOYJI">#4/10 Antonio Gandy-Golden Blue Crystals Rookie Auto 2020 Leaf Metal Autograph</a> - Priced at $30.00<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/255398444883?hash=item3b76eeff53:g:2FgAAOSwjX1iFAY1">Travis Etienne LEAF METAL DRAFT PORTRAIT MOJO BLUE #d 6/10 Jaguars</a> - Priced at $50.00<br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/324784088818?hash=item4b9ea3e6f2:g:0OgAAOSwKX5hOk2l">#6/10 Collin Johnson Crystal Rookie Auto 2020 Leaf Metal Autograph Texas Jaguars</a> - Priced at $25.00</p>
<p>These cards share similar characteristics with the AJ Dillon card, such as being rookie autographs, blue crystals/mojo, and numbered to 10.</p>
<p>However, there are some factors that could increase the value of the AJ Dillon card:</p>
<p>1. AJ Dillon has become a more prominent player than the compared players.<br />
2. The card has a PSA grade of 9, which adds value.<br />
3. Green Bay Packers cards tend to be more popular and valuable due to the team's large fan base.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the AJ Dillon card to be in the range of $100 to $150. This takes into account the comparable sales, the player's increasing popularity, the PSA grade, and the team factor.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the 2020 Donruss Optic Justin Herbert #153 Rated Rookie Blue Scope PSA 10 GEM MINT card.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/186309824880?hash=item2b60ee5170:g:3HIAAOSwooNl1klv">2020 Panini Donruss Optic - Justin Herbert - Blue Scope Rookie RC #153 PSA 10</a> priced at $299.99<br />

<p>These two listings are for the exact same card (Blue Scope version, PSA 10) as the one we're evaluating. The prices are relatively close, ranging from $249.99 to $299.99.</p>
<p>Other relevant listings that can provide context:</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/185738239485?hash=item2b3edc9dfd:g:ogsAAOSw1rNjbFMX">2020 Donruss Optic Justin Herbert Silver Holo Rated Rookie #153 PSA 10 Gem Mint</a> priced at $400.00<br />

<p>The Silver Holo and Blue Hyper versions are different parallels but still provide a good reference point for rare variations of this card.</p>
<p>Considering these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Donruss Optic Justin Herbert #153 Rated Rookie Blue Scope PSA 10 GEM MINT to be in the range of $250 to $300.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=250</p>
<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the observed price range for this specific card. The Blue Scope parallel is a desirable version, and the PSA 10 grade adds significant value. However, it's important to note that card prices can fluctuate based on market conditions and individual buyer interest.

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "2020 Select Jordan Love Field Level Maroon Die-Cut Prizm Rookie RC #347 PSA 10" card. Let's analyze the relevant comparable cards from the list:</p>

<p>The card in question is a Maroon Die-Cut Prizm, which is not exactly matched in the list. However, we can see that different color variations of Jordan Love's Die-Cut Prizms from the same set range from $140 to $300, with most falling in the $150-$200 range.</p>
<p>Considering that the card is graded PSA 10 (which typically commands a premium over PSA 9), and that the Maroon Die-Cut is likely a more limited edition than some of the other colors, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be in the range of $180 to $250.</p>
<p>Given these factors, I would set the lower end of the estimated price range as the fair value estimate.</p>

<p>There's also a higher-end card to consider:<br />

<p>Considering these comparables, I would estimate the fair value of the card in question to be in the range of $500-$800. The lower end of this range aligns with the most similar cards, while the upper end accounts for potential premium due to the low serial number (04/25).</p>

<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are the PSA 10 graded Jalen Hurts Rated Rookie Canvas cards from the 2020 Donruss set. Here are some key examples:</p>

<p>Based on these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Donruss Jalen Hurts Rated Rookie Canvas PSA 10 card to be in the range of $65 to $100. The lower-end prices seem to be around $65-$80, while some sellers are asking for higher prices.</p>
<p>Taking the lower portion of this estimated range:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=65</p>
<p>It's worth noting that prices can fluctuate based on market conditions, the player's performance, and other factors. Additionally, some of the higher-priced listings might be optimistic or include other factors not apparent from the title alone.

                        Based on the provided information, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 'Justin Herbert Select Red die-cut graded rookie card'. </p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are the red die-cut Justin Herbert rookie cards. Specifically, we have:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/374379619432?hash=item572ac3a468:g:3noAAOSwSJtjhlSw">2020 Panini Select Die Cut Red Prizm RC Justin Herbert #144 PSA 10 Gem MT</a> priced at $169.00</p>

<p>The price difference between these two cards is significant due to the grading, with the PSA 10 card being more than twice the value of the PSA 9.</p>
<p>Without knowing the specific grade of the card in question, we can estimate that its value would fall somewhere in this range, likely closer to the lower end if it's not a perfect PSA 10.</p>
<p>Other similar die-cut cards of different colors are priced between $100-$185 for PSA 10 grades, which supports this estimate.</p>
<p>Given these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the 'Justin Herbert Select Red die-cut graded rookie card' to be around $100-$150, depending on its exact grade.</p>

<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the observed price range for comparable PSA 10 graded Justin Herbert Select Concourse rookie cards. The actual market value may fluctuate based on factors such as overall market conditions, the player's performance, and individual buyer preferences.

<p>The base Prizm Draft Picks card in PSA 10 condition seems to be valued between $60 and $175. The higher-priced listings might be for rarer variations like Silver Prizm, which command a premium.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, a fair estimate for the value of the card in question would be in the range of $60 to $100. The lower end of this range aligns with the more common listings, while the upper end accounts for potential market fluctuations and the card's high grade.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I'll analyze the relevant football cards to estimate a fair value for the De'Andre Swift rookie card.</p>
<p>The key features of the card in question are:<br />
1. It's a De'Andre Swift rookie card<br />
2. From the 2020 Playoff set<br />
3. Wave parallel<br />
4. Numbered to /10<br />
5. Population 1 (unique)</p>
<p>While there aren't many exact comparables in the provided list, we can use some similar cards to estimate the value:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276454194425?hash=item405df43cf9:g:2A4AAOSwFgJmOPpC">2020 Playoff Football Jonathan Taylor Rookie Wave Silver RC #RW-16 Colts</a> is priced at $5.00. This is a similar card but not numbered and likely more common.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/115936338326?hash=item1afe582196:g:GYMAAOSwD4NlIZSH">2020 Panini Playoff Jalen Hurts Rookie Wave RED PSA 10 Rookie RC Low Pop</a> is priced at $64.00. This is a graded card of a more popular player, but it gives us an idea of the potential for rare Playoff Wave rookies.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/166848202368?hash=item26d8ed8680:g:Ih4AAOSwCbtmgXN~">2020 PANINI PLAYOFF ROOKIE WAVE JALEN HURTS RC EAGLES</a> is priced at $55.00. This is an ungraded version of a similar card for a more popular player.</p>
<p>Considering that the De'Andre Swift card is numbered to only 10 and has a population of 1, it should command a significant premium over the Jonathan Taylor card. However, Swift isn't as popular as Hurts, so it likely won't reach the same prices as the Hurts cards.</p>
<p>Given the rarity and the current market for similar cards, I would estimate the value of the De'Andre Swift rookie card to be in the range of $75-$125.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=75</p>
<p>The lower end of this range ($75) takes into account that while the card is very rare, De'Andre Swift isn't as highly collectible as some other players. The upper end of the range accounts for the extreme rarity of the card. Collectors who specifically seek out low-numbered Swift cards or complete their Playoff Wave sets might be willing to pay more.

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "2020 Panini Sticker Cards #121 Clyde Edwards-Helaire RC Silver PSA 9 Pop 4" card. Let's analyze the relevant comparisons:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/143891780415?hash=item21809e533f:g:~toAAOSwNTpf3qYz">Clyde Edwards-Helaire Rookie - 2020 Panini Sticker Collection - KC Chiefs</a> is priced at $3.75, but this is likely for an ungraded card.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/394078002800?hash=item5bc0e11e70:g:5KYAAOSw3KViPde4">Clyde Edwards-Helaire 2020 Sticker Cards Blue Foil (/299) and Silver</a> is priced at $6.00, which includes both a numbered parallel and a silver version, but again, these are likely ungraded.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/143895238434?hash=item2180d31722:g:KwUAAOSw~MFfki3h">2020 Panini Clyde Edwards Helaire Rookie Kansas City Chiefs</a> is priced at $2.99, but this is also likely an ungraded card.</p>
<p>The card in question is graded PSA 9 with a population of only 4, which significantly increases its value compared to raw cards. While there isn't an exact match in the comparison list, we can look at other rookie cards from the same set and year that are graded:</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266539381265?hash=item3e0efc3211:g:k7oAAOSwuD1lZplb">2020 Panini Sticker Cards #70 Tua Tagovailoa RC PSA 10 Gem Mint Dolphins Pop 9</a> is priced at $124.99, but this is a PSA 10 of a more high-profile rookie.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/265742757112?hash=item3ddf80acf8:g:FyoAAOSwDzdirfhA">Jake Fromm RC 2020 Panini Stickers Cards PSA 9 Mint Rookie Buffalo New York</a> is priced at $19.99, which is a closer comparison as it's also a PSA 9 from the same year and set.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Clyde Edwards-Helaire PSA 9 card to be between $30 and $50. The PSA 9 grade and low population add significant value over the raw card prices, but Edwards-Helaire isn't as high-profile as some other rookies from that year.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Mosaic Green RC Clyde Edwards-Helaire #212 Kansas City Chiefs PSA 10 card.</p>
<p>After analyzing the relevant comparable cards, I believe a fair estimate for this card would be in the range of $45 to $60. Here's my reasoning:</p>
<p>1. The most directly comparable card is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225163992348?hash=item346cd1dd1c:g:5AkAAOSwnzhjIqF6">2020 Clyde Edwards Helaire Panini Green Mosaic Prizm RC PSA 10 Gem Mint Chiefs</a>, which is priced at $49.99. This is essentially the same card as the one we're evaluating.</p>
<p>2. Another relevant comparison is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/395766753834?hash=item5c25896a2a:g:wQ8AAOSwrVBiDV5q">2020 Panini Mosaic - Clyde Edwards-Helaire - Rookie Green Prizm PSA 10 Gem Mint</a>, priced at $80.00. This appears to be the same card, but the price seems a bit high compared to other listings.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/353860433839?hash=item5263b9b7af:g:WIUAAOSwUYph5GdR">Clyde Edwards Helaire 2020 mosaic reactive green #212 psa 10</a> is priced at $42.50, which is slightly lower but still in a similar range.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/354355004140?hash=item52813442ec:g:DPEAAOSwetljVzSJ">2020 Panini Mosaic CLYDE EDWARDS HELAIRE SILVER PRIZM CHIEFS ROOKIE #212 PSA 10</a> is listed at $59.99. While this is a silver prizm rather than green, it provides a good reference point for the player's PSA 10 rookie cards.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/363351875875?hash=item549975a123:g:6CgAAOSwM~Bgblzw">Clyde Edwards-Helaire Chiefs RC LSU - Silver Prizm 2020 Panini Mosaic PSA 9 Mint</a> is priced at $114.99, but this seems overpriced compared to other listings, especially considering it's a PSA 9 rather than a PSA 10.</p>
<p>Considering these comparables, with more weight given to the direct matches, I estimate the fair value of the card to be around $45 to $60. The lower end of this range aligns well with the most directly comparable listing.</p>

<p>Looking at the comparable cards, we have several relevant options:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386348709234?hash=item59f42d7572:g:tZkAAOSwV-tlFIod">2020 Donruss Optic Rated Rookie Tua Tagovailoa RC Miami Dolphins CSG 9.5</a> priced at $39.97<br />

4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/313786976846?hash=item490f294a4e:g:Wq8AAOSwhYlhsnbK">2020 Donruss Optic #152 Tua Tagovailoa Dolphins RC Rookie CSG 9 MINT</a> priced at $19.99</p>
<p>These cards are very similar to the one in question, with the same player, set, and grading company (CSG) or equivalent grade (SGC 9 is comparable to CSG 9).</p>
<p>The prices for these comparable cards range from $19.99 to $49.99. The card in question is graded as MINT CSG 9, which is a strong grade but not as high as the CSG 9.5 card listed.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the "Tua Tagovailoa Rated Rookie MINT CSG 9" card to be in the range of $30 to $40.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=30</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the lower end of the price range for similar cards, allowing for potential market fluctuations and the specific condition of the card in question. The actual market value could be higher depending on demand and the card's eye appeal, but $30 represents a conservative estimate based on the provided data.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of the Jordan Love 2020 Select Field Level Silver #347 RC Green Bay Packers card.</p>
<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, it appears that the base version of this card (non-silver) typically sells for around $15 to $30. However, the card in question is a Silver variant, which generally commands a premium over the base version.</p>
<p>Some relevant comparisons include:</p>

<p>However, this price seems to be an outlier and likely overpriced.</p>
<p>Considering the premium for Silver variants and the prices of base cards, a fair estimate for the Jordan Love 2020 Select Field Level Silver #347 RC would be in the range of $40 to $60.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=40</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the lower end of the range, as requested. The actual market value could be slightly higher, but $40 represents a conservative estimate based on the available data.

<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/385299738358?hash=item59b5a76ef6:g:vpgAAOSwFGBjndgm">2020 Panini Prizm DP Justin Herbert Silver Rookie Prizm PSA 9 Mint Chargers #102</a> priced at $49.99<br />

<p>These cards are all Justin Herbert rookie cards from the 2020 Panini Prizm set, which matches our target card. However, there are some key differences to consider:</p>
<p>1. The target card has a BGS 9.5 grade, which is generally considered slightly higher than a PSA 9 but lower than a PSA 10.<br />
2. The target card is specifically noted as a "DP Silver RC," which likely stands for "Draft Picks Silver Rookie Card." This matches closely with the comparable cards.</p>
<p>Given these factors, we can estimate that the target card would be valued higher than the PSA 9 versions but potentially lower than or similar to the PSA 10 version. The BGS 9.5 grade is a strong grade that collectors value highly.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, a fair estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Prizm Justin Herbert DP Silver RC Chargers QB BGS 9.5 Gem Mint Grade card would be in the range of $80 to $120.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=80</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the strong grade, the popularity of Justin Herbert as a quarterback, and the desirability of Prizm Silver rookie cards. However, please note that the sports card market can be volatile, and prices can fluctuate based on player performance, market trends, and other factors.

<p>The card in question is a base Rated Rookie card graded PSA 10, which is generally less valuable than special parallels like Holo or Blue Hyper. However, the PSA 10 grade adds significant value compared to PSA 9 cards.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Michael Pittman Jr. Panini Donruss Optic Rated Rookie PSA 10 to be in the range of $45 to $60.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=45</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account that it's a base card but in perfect condition (PSA 10), placing it above the value of special parallels in PSA 9 condition but below the value of special parallels in PSA 10 condition.

<p>The base versions of the Tee Higgins rookie card are consistently priced at $15.00. The Green Pulsar Prizm version, which is a rarer parallel, is priced higher at $57.95. </p>
<p>Given that the card in question is described as a "Game 21" card, it might be a slightly different variant or parallel. However, without more specific information about its rarity or special features, it's safer to estimate its value closer to the base versions.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be between $15 and $25. The lower end of this range aligns with the base versions, while the upper end allows for the possibility that the "Game 21" designation adds some value.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Illusions Football Refractor Jalen Hurts RC Eagles card.</p>
<p>The product title mentions a "Refractor" version, which typically commands a premium over base cards. However, most of the comparable listings in the COMPARE_ARRAY are for the base version of the card. </p>
<p>Looking at the relevant listings:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/393572148270?hash=item5ba2ba642e:g:1egAAOSwf~ZhQM29">2020 Panini Illusions #11 Jalen Hurts Rookie Eagles</a> is priced at $6.29<br />

<p>These prices are for the base version of the card. Given that the card in question is a Refractor version, which typically carries a premium, we can estimate its value to be slightly higher than these base versions.</p>
<p>Considering the refractor premium and the range of prices for the base card, a fair estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Illusions Football Refractor Jalen Hurts RC Eagles would be in the range of $12 to $18.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=12</p>
<p>Keep in mind that card conditions, market fluctuations, and individual seller pricing strategies can affect the actual selling price. Additionally, as Jalen Hurts' performance continues to improve, the value of his rookie cards may increase over time.

<p>The most relevant comparisons from the provided list are the graded Tua Tagovailoa rookie cards from the 2020 Panini Illusions set. However, it's important to note that the card in question is graded by GMA (Graded Modern Cards) at a 10, while most of the comparable cards are graded by PSA.</p>
<p>Here are some relevant comparisons:</p>

<p>These PSA 10 graded cards range from $44.99 to $50.00. However, it's important to note that GMA-graded cards typically sell for less than PSA-graded cards, as PSA is generally considered more prestigious in the card collecting community.</p>
<p>Considering this, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Illusions Tua Tagovailoa Rookie GMA 10 Gem MT Miami Dolphins #6 to be between $30 and $40.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=30</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the lower perceived value of GMA grading compared to PSA, while still acknowledging the card's high grade and Tua Tagovailoa's popularity as a young quarterback.

                        Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the relevant football cards to estimate a fair value for the 2023 DONRUSS OPTIC DEMARIO DOUGLAS ROOKIE PRIMARY COLORS #16 PSA 10 card.</p>
<p>The most directly comparable card is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/375547188896?hash=item57705b56a0:g:ylsAAOSwntZmm2J8">2023 DONRUSS OPTIC DEMARIO DOUGLAS ROOKIE PRIMARY COLORS #16 PSA 10 - A10066</a>, which is listed at $55.00. This is an exact match to the card we're evaluating, so it provides a strong baseline for our estimate.</p>
<p>Other relevant comparisons include:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/395715311216?hash=item5c22787670:g:mgYAAOSwguRm8Gam">PSA 10 ANTHONY RICHARDSON 2023 PANINI DONRUSS OPTIC Purple Shock #247 ROOKIE RC</a> at $95.00<br />

<p>These cards are from the same year and product line (2023 Donruss Optic), are also rookies, and have the same PSA 10 grade. However, they feature more high-profile players, which explains their higher prices.</p>
<p>Considering that Demario Douglas is a less prominent rookie compared to players like Anthony Richardson or CJ Stroud, the $55.00 price point seems reasonable. However, given that it's a PSA 10 and part of a special insert set (Primary Colors), there might be some room for a slightly higher valuation.</p>
<p>Based on these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the 2023 DONRUSS OPTIC DEMARIO DOUGLAS ROOKIE PRIMARY COLORS #16 PSA 10 card to be in the range of $55 to $70.</p>

<p>After analyzing the comparable sales, it appears that the prices for this specific card vary quite a bit, ranging from around $4 to $25 for raw (ungraded) copies. However, most of the listings fall within the $5 to $15 range.</p>
<p>Some relevant examples include:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204710255681?hash=item2fa9ae9c41:g:uLsAAOSw8f1mAHyf">2020 Panini Chronicles Prizm Black Football Brandon Aiyuk #PB-14 Rookie</a> at $4.00<br />

<p>Given the range of prices and the frequency of listings, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be between $8 and $12. The lower end of this range takes into account the numerous listings under $10, while the upper end considers the higher-priced listings that may represent cards in better condition.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=8</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the condition of the card plays a significant role in its value. Cards in mint or near-mint condition would fetch prices at the higher end of the range or even above it. Additionally, graded copies, especially those with high grades, would command a premium, as evidenced by the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315061259813?hash=item495b1d4e25:g:GFMAAOSwLeZljrec">BGS 9.5 graded copy</a> listed at $65.00.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the value of the 2020 NFL Joe Burrow Rookie RC card.</p>
<p>Joe Burrow is one of the most sought-after rookies from the 2020 NFL draft class, so his cards generally command higher prices compared to other rookies from the same year. Looking at the comparable sales in the list, we can see a few relevant Joe Burrow cards:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204955527671?hash=item2fb84d29f7:g:eRMAAOSwH~Bmx5aB">2020 Donruss Joe Burrow The Rookies Holo Checkerboard Rc! Very Nice, Clean,card!</a> priced at $75.00<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/334980967342?hash=item4dfe6bebae:g:KFUAAOSwDatk0j4C">2020 Joe Burrow Panini Donruss The Rookies RC #TR-JB PSA 9 MINT</a> priced at $49.99<br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/305669346564?hash=item472b501504:g:sbEAAOSwM99mkGbD">2020 Panini Donruss Joe Burrow The Rookies #TR-JB PSA 9 Mint</a> priced at $45.99<br />
4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/265529083267?hash=item3dd2c44583:g:VkgAAOSwq4Nh-YmG">2020 Panini Donruss The Rookies Joe Burrow Cincinnati Bengals</a> priced at $29.99</p>
<p>The prices for Joe Burrow cards range from about $30 to $75, with graded cards (PSA 9) falling in the middle of this range. Since the PRODUCT_TITLE doesn't specify if the card is graded or if it's a special parallel (like the Holo Checkerboard), we should estimate conservatively.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, a fair value estimate for a basic 2020 NFL Joe Burrow Rookie RC would be in the range of $30 to $50. To be conservative, we'll use the lower end of this range.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=30</p>
<p>This estimate of $30 represents the lower portion of the estimated price range for a basic Joe Burrow rookie card from 2020. Keep in mind that the actual value could be higher depending on the specific card's condition, brand, and any special features it might have.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the "ROOKIE Bradlee Anae RC AUTO /99" card.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296664726625?hash=item4512987c61:g:nXMAAOSwSD1mhkJE">2020 Panini Limited 27/199 Bradlee Anae RC Auto #193 Dallas Cowboys</a> priced at $10.00<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386983229052?hash=item5a19ff767c:g:gVAAAOSwey5mN~c3">2020 Panini Limited Emerald #193 BRADLEE ANAE Auto/Autograph Rookie RC #1/5</a> priced at $29.95</p>
<p>These two cards provide a good baseline for estimating the value of the card in question. The first card is similar but has a higher print run (/199 vs /99), while the second card is much rarer (/5) and thus more expensive.</p>
<p>Given that the card we're evaluating is numbered to 99, it should be valued higher than the /199 version but lower than the /5 version. The /99 designation makes it somewhat scarce, which adds to its value.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, a fair estimate for the "ROOKIE Bradlee Anae RC AUTO /99" card would be in the range of $15 to $20.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=15</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the player's relative popularity, the scarcity of the card (being numbered to 99), and the fact that it's an autographed rookie card. However, it's important to note that the actual market value can fluctuate based on factors such as the player's performance, collector demand, and overall condition of the card.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 2020 PANINI PHOENIX FLAME THROWERS TUA TAGOVAILOA #29 ROOKIE PSA 10 GEM MINT card.</p>
<p>After analyzing the relevant cards in the list, I believe a fair value estimate for this card would be in the range of $70 to $85. </p>
<p>This estimate is based on several factors:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/196628226079?hash=item2dc7f4a01f:g:bb8AAOSwJ0ZlKhvO">The exact same card</a> is listed at $74.99.<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/326162133326?hash=item4bf0c7314e:g:q3MAAOSwr99manQ9">A very similar card</a> (potentially the same, just described slightly differently) is priced at $79.99.<br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/166725457998?hash=item26d19c984e:g:rJUAAOSwPz1mJT~u">Another listing for what appears to be the same card</a> is priced at $100.00, which seems to be on the higher end.</p>
<p>The lower-priced <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/145519725598?hash=item21e1a6cc1e:g:KhsAAOSwS9ZliwXT">silver version at $49.50</a> and the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/114573882893?hash=item1aad22b60d:g:-PQAAOSwCQNf1Zry">non-graded version at $39.99</a> provide a baseline, while the more rare versions like the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/403807865542?hash=item5e04d30ac6:g:KZIAAOSwCTJi5uyA">Pink /199 at $115.00</a> and the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204842825097?hash=item2fb1957589:g:sbgAAOSwuzNlqpoW">Black /10 at $850.25</a> represent the upper end of the spectrum for this card series.</p>
<p>Given these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be around $75, which aligns closely with the lower-priced listings of the same card.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=75</p>
<p>It's worth noting that prices can fluctuate based on market conditions, the player's performance, and collector demand. The PSA 10 grade significantly enhances the card's value compared to ungraded or lower-graded versions of the same card.

<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, it appears that the price for this card varies quite a bit. Let's look at the most relevant comparisons:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/196623220741?hash=item2dc7a84005:g:9HoAAOSwGM9m370j">2020 Michael Pittman Jr. RC Panini Select #62 PSA 10</a> is listed at $23.00, which is an exact match for the card in question.</p>

<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/355084575043?hash=item52acb0a143:g:61cAAOSwJdVlHxlb">2020 Panini Select Michael Pittman Jr. Purple Die Cut # 62 ISA GEM MT 10 Colts</a> is listed at $19.99. This is a variant (Purple Die Cut) of the same card, also in gem mint condition.</p>

<p>Considering these comparisons, with special emphasis on the exact match and the CSG 10 graded version, a fair value estimate for the 2020 Michael Pittman Jr. RC Panini Select #62 PSA 10 would be in the range of $20 to $25.</p>
<p>Given that we're asked to provide the lower portion of the estimated price range:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=20</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the exact match listing, similar graded versions, and the overall market for this card. The PSA 10 grade adds significant value compared to ungraded or lower-graded versions of the same card.

                        Based on the provided information, I'll analyze the relevant football cards to estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Phoenix D'Andre Swift Fire Burst Gem Mint Rookie PSA 10 Eagles RC.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276319508082?hash=item4055ed1672:g:ba0AAOSw8sRlwDAJ">2020 Panini Phoenix #109 Dandre Swift Fire Burst Sgc 9.5</a> - $32.00<br />

<p>These cards are the same player and set, with the main difference being the grading. The PSA 10 card is priced higher than the SGC 9.5, which is expected.</p>
<p>Other relevant comparisons of Fire Burst rookies from the same set include:</p>

<p>The Jalen Hurts PSA 10 card is priced significantly higher, likely due to his increased popularity and performance.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Phoenix D'Andre Swift Fire Burst Gem Mint Rookie PSA 10 Eagles RC to be between $45 and $60. The lower end of this range matches the exact card in the list, while the upper end accounts for potential market fluctuations and the card's PSA 10 grade.</p>

<p>These cards are all David Onyemata Select die-cuts from 2020, which makes them the most comparable to the card in question. The Red Blue Wave variant is likely to be slightly more valuable than the standard red or purple variants due to its more eye-catching design.</p>
<p>Other comparable die-cut cards from the 2020 Select set for less prominent players are generally priced between $2 and $8, with most falling in the $3-$5 range.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Select Club Level Red Blue Wave David Onyemata Saints Die Cut to be in the range of $4 to $6.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=4</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account that the Red Blue Wave variant might command a slight premium over the standard colored die-cuts, but also considers that David Onyemata is not a high-profile player, which limits the card's overall value.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 'Dallas Cowboys FleaFlicker Mosaic Silver' card.</p>
<p>While there isn't an exact match for a silver version of the Dallas Cowboys Flea Flicker card in the provided list, we can use similar cards to estimate its value. </p>
<p>The most relevant cards to consider are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/203580511976?hash=item2f665816e8:g:QtoAAOSw2KNhJoOm">2020 Panini Mosaic Footall Dallas Cowboys Flea Flicker #FF5</a> priced at $2.50<br />

<p>These are base versions of the Dallas Cowboys Flea Flicker card. The silver version typically commands a premium over the base version.</p>
<p>We can also look at other silver Flea Flicker cards for reference:</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386619518879?hash=item5a0451af9f:g:hggAAOSwompkh~-Y">2020 Mosaic Flea Flicker Silver Prizm Brown/Lamar Jackson/Ingram</a> priced at $7.49<br />

<p>Considering these prices, I would estimate the value of the 'Dallas Cowboys FleaFlicker Mosaic Silver' to be in the range of $5 to $8. The silver version should be priced higher than the base versions, but likely not as high as the Lamar Jackson silver card.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=5.00</p>
<p>This estimate of $5.00 represents the lower end of the estimated range, accounting for potential market fluctuations and the fact that the Cowboys card might not command as high a premium as the Lamar Jackson card.

<p>These listings provide a good range for the card's value. There are a few outliers with higher prices, but they seem to be either special editions (like color variants) or possibly overpriced.</p>
<p>Based on these comparable sales, I would estimate the fair value of the "JUSTIN HERBERT ROOKIE 2020 PANINI ABSOLUTE-#167 PSA 10" card to be in the range of $50 to $65.</p>
<p>To provide a specific price estimate, I'll use the lower end of this range:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=50</p>
<p>This estimate of $50 represents a conservative fair value for the card, based on the current market as reflected in the provided listings. It's worth noting that the actual selling price can vary based on factors such as the specific condition of the card, current market demand, and individual buyer preferences.

5. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/126001649741?hash=item1d5648984d:g:7CIAAOSw~bdkpDOd">2020 Panini Score Justin Herbert  PSA 10 GEM MINT 362 RC Rookie Chargers</a> priced at $39.99</p>
<p>These listings give us a good range of prices for the card in question. The lowest price is $35.00, and the highest is $69.99. Most of the listings fall in the $35-$50 range.</p>
<p>Considering these prices, a fair estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Score Justin Herbert 362 Rookie Card PSA 10 would be between $35 and $45. This takes into account the lower end of the price range while acknowledging that some sellers are pricing it higher.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=35</p>
<p>To provide a specific estimate, I would say the fair value of this card is around $35, which represents the lower end of the observed price range. This price point is supported by multiple listings and seems to be a reasonable starting point for the card's value. However, buyers should be aware that prices can fluctuate based on market demand and individual seller preferences.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the fair value of the football card. The most relevant comparison is the exact match:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/255561960956?hash=item3b80ae0dfc:g:Ea4AAOSwi61ilmeb">2020 PANINI MOSAIC JALEN REAGOR NFL DEBUT ROOKIE PSA Auto grade GEM MT 10</a> priced at $50.00.</p>
<p>However, we should consider other Jalen Reagor cards and similar rookie cards for context:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/224493596220?hash=item3444dc6e3c:g:TvsAAOSw7zZgwws3">Mosaic NFL Eagles Jalen Reagor Red Choice Fusion #54/80 Rookie Card *MINT PSA 9*</a> at $49.99<br />

<p>It's important to note that the card in question is both autographed and graded PSA 10 (GEM MT), which significantly increases its value compared to non-autographed or lower-graded cards.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I estimate the fair value of the "2020 PANINI MOSAIC JALEN REAGOR NFL DEBUT ROOKIE PSA Auto grade GEM MT 10" card to be in the range of $45 to $60.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=45</p>
<p>The lower portion of the estimated price range is set at $45, as requested. This takes into account the exact match price, while also considering that market fluctuations and individual buyer preferences can affect the final selling price.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 2020 Leaf Draft #2 Tua Tagovailoa RC Gold PSA 10 Gem Mint Dolphins Low Pop card.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225453015361?hash=item347e0c0141:g:4Z0AAOSwEC1jDx5f">2020 LEAF DRAFT #2 TUA TAGOVAILOA GOLD PSA 10 Tough grade!</a> priced at $39.99<br />

<p>These two cards are the most similar to the one in question, as they are the same player, same year, same set, same card number, and same PSA 10 grade. The main difference is that the card in question is described as "Low Pop," which suggests it might be slightly more valuable.</p>
<p>Other relevant cards, though with lower grades or different certification, include:</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/405074562945?hash=item5e50534f81:g:D-UAAOSwrCdmjyIT">2020 Leaf Draft Gold Tua Tagovailoa #02 PSA 9 MINT Rookie RC</a> priced at $15.00<br />

<p>Considering these comparisons and the "Low Pop" designation, I would estimate the fair value of the card to be in the range of $40 to $50. The lower end of this range aligns with the highest-priced comparable card, while the upper end accounts for the potential added value of the low population.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the "ROOKIE Jalen Reagor Pink Prizm Eagles" card.</p>

<p>These cards are all Jalen Reagor rookie cards from the 2020 Prizm set, with various parallels (Silver and Pink). The Pink Prizm parallel is typically more desirable than the base Silver, which could increase its value slightly.</p>
<p>Other relevant comparisons for Pink Prizm rookie cards of similar players from the same set:</p>

<p>Considering these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Jalen Reagor Pink Prizm Eagles" card to be in the range of $8 to $12. The Pink Prizm parallel adds some value, but Reagor's performance hasn't been as strong as some other rookies from his class, which may affect the card's value.</p>

<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, I can see that there's a significant range in prices for this specific card. Let's focus on the most relevant comparisons:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/266760845136?hash=item3e1c2f7750:g:C68AAOSwhCRmFIh1">2020 Panini Mosaic NFL Debut Joe Burrow #261 PSA 10 GEM MINT Rookie RC</a> is priced at $64.99.<br />

<p>There's a significant outlier with the $950.00 listing, which seems to be an anomaly or potentially a different variant of the card. Excluding this, the other PSA 10 graded Joe Burrow NFL Debut cards from the 2020 Panini Mosaic set range from about $65 to $100.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be in the range of $65 to $100. To be conservative and account for potential market fluctuations, I'll set the estimated value at the lower end of this range.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=65</p>
<p>This estimate of $65 represents the lower portion of the fair value range for the card based on the provided comparison data. However, it's important to note that the actual market value can fluctuate based on various factors such as card condition, market demand, and the specific seller.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of the 2020 Panini Absolute Football Jalen Hurts Rookie Card for the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, it appears that the value of this card varies significantly depending on its condition and whether it has been graded. Ungraded raw cards tend to be less expensive, while professionally graded cards, especially those in high grades, command higher prices.</p>
<p>For an ungraded version of this card, the fair value seems to range from about $3 to $12. Some examples include:</p>

<p>For graded versions in top condition (PSA 10 or equivalent), the value increases significantly:</p>

<p>Considering these factors, a fair estimate for an ungraded version of this card in good condition would be around $5 to $10. For the purposes of this response, I'll set the lower end of this range as the PRICE_RESPONSE.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=5</p>
<p>It's important to note that the actual value can vary based on the card's condition, market demand, and other factors. If the card is in pristine condition and could potentially grade highly, its value could be significantly higher.

                        Based on the provided COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the "Justin Jefferson ROOKIE Vikings Football" card. The most relevant cards in the list are the 2020 Panini Mosaic Justin Jefferson NFL Debut Rookie cards, as they seem to be the closest match to the product title you've provided.</p>
<p>After analyzing the prices of these cards, I would estimate the fair value of the Justin Jefferson rookie card to be in the range of $5 to $15. Here's my reasoning:</p>
<p>1. There are several listings for the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/143905598181?hash=item2181712ae5:g:sX8AAOSwGgdf74U6">2020 Mosaic Football Justin Jefferson Rookie NFL Debut RC</a> card, with prices ranging from $3 to $25.</p>
<p>2. The most common price points for this card seem to be between $5 and $10. For example:<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/126296738008?hash=item1d67df48d8:g:jxQAAOSwjntlsEG7">2020 Panini Mosaic Justin Jefferson RC #279 Minnesota Vikings Rookie</a> is priced at $5.95<br />

<p>3. Some listings are priced higher, such as:<br />

<p>4. There are also a few outliers with higher prices, but these seem to be less common and may not reflect the true market value.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the card to be around $10, which is in the middle of the most common price range.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=10</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the actual value can fluctuate based on factors such as the card's condition, market demand, and any special features or variations that might not be apparent from the title alone.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the J.K. Dobbins Refractor ROOKIE Ravens card. While the exact card isn't present in the comparison list, we can use similar cards to estimate its value.</p>
<p>The most relevant cards for comparison are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/285980617439?hash=item4295c5eadf:g:rNAAAOSw~G9mpFwX">J.K. DOBBINS 2020 Panini Certified Rookie Graffiti RC LA Chargers #2020-JKD</a> priced at $4.00<br />

4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/385386958368?hash=item59bada4e20:g:dZkAAOSwhhdj2qev">K57,635 - 2020 Certified 2020 #10 J.K. Dobbins</a> priced at $3.95</p>
<p>The card in question is a Refractor, which typically commands a premium over standard cards. Considering this and the prices of similar J.K. Dobbins rookie cards, I would estimate the value of the J.K. Dobbins Refractor ROOKIE Ravens card to be in the range of $10 to $15.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=10</p>
<p>The lower end of this range, $10, is set as the PRICE_RESPONSE. This estimate takes into account that Refractor cards are generally more valuable than standard inserts or base rookies, but also considers that J.K. Dobbins' cards are not priced as high as some other rookies from the same year (like Joe Burrow or Justin Jefferson) in the provided list.

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Justin Herbert RC Pink Chargers" card. The pink variation of this card seems to be somewhat scarcer than the base version, which can affect its value.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Justin Herbert RC Green Chargers" card. </p>
<p>The key factors to consider are:<br />
1. It's a Justin Herbert rookie card<br />
2. It's from the Panini Chronicles set<br />
3. It's a green parallel version</p>
<p>Looking at the comparable sales, we can see that Justin Herbert rookie cards from the 2020 Panini Chronicles set have a wide range of prices depending on factors like grading and parallel versions. </p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/165872916528?hash=item269ecbd830:g:RNAAAOSwdJZjuOAO">2020 Panini Chronicles Panini Justin Herbert Green Parallel Rookie Card #PA-3 RC</a> priced at $3.99<br />

<p>The green parallel seems to command a slight premium over the base versions, which are selling for around $4-$5. However, the condition of the card is not specified in the PRODUCT_TITLE, so we can't assume it's graded.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Justin Herbert RC Green Chargers" card to be in the range of $8 to $12, with the lower end being more likely if the card is ungraded.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Damon Arnette RC AUTO Raiders" card. Let's analyze the relevant cards from the COMPARE_ARRAY:</p>
<p>1. The base rookie cards of Damon Arnette without autographs are selling for around $1-$2. For example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204505080561?hash=item2f9d73e2f1:g:zl4AAOSwi6plLy0t">2020 Panini Absolute #123 - Damon Arnette Rookie RC Raiders</a> is priced at $1.75.</p>
<p>2. Rookie autograph cards of other players from the same set are selling for higher prices. For instance, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/383882215908?hash=item596129c1e4:g:bu8AAOSwOA9f7OYf">2020 PANINI ABSOLUTE ANTHONY GORDON #105 ROOKIE AUTO SEATTLE SEAHAWKS</a> is priced at $4.99.</p>
<p>3. The most relevant comparison is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/265553408289?hash=item3dd4377121:g:fYUAAOSwfBdiDb6c">Damon Arnette 2020 Absolute Football Auto Rookie RC Card RAIDERS</a>, which is priced at $9.99. This appears to be the same or very similar card to the one in question.</p>
<p>4. There's also a rare parallel version, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/114459908614?hash=item1aa6579a06:g:DgIAAOSw3uxfhMFE">2020 PANINI ABSOLUTE DAMON ARNETTE #123 ROOKIE AUTO PURPLE 5/5 RAIDERS</a>, priced at $19.99, but this is likely not comparable due to its rarity.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Damon Arnette RC AUTO Raiders" card to be in the range of $8 to $12. The autograph significantly increases the value compared to the base rookie cards, but Arnette is not considered a top-tier player, which limits the price ceiling.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "2020 Mosaic Base Rookies Mosaic Camo Pink #206 Jerry Jeudy PSA 10" card. Let's analyze the relevant comparisons:</p>
<p>1. The exact match: <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315818561384?hash=item498840cf68:g:E0sAAOSw7NxnAfbg">2020 Mosaic Base Rookies Mosaic Camo Pink #206 Jerry Jeudy PSA 10</a> is priced at $14.00. This is the most relevant comparison as it's the same card and grade.</p>
<p>2. Other Jerry Jeudy Pink Camo cards (ungraded):<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/404450269128?hash=item5e2b1d57c8:g:qyIAAOSwXBFk4lUl">2020 Mosaic Jerry Jeudy Pink Camo Prizm Rookie RC #206 Broncos</a> at $2.50<br />

<p>3. Other Jerry Jeudy Mosaic cards:<br />
   - <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/146075513436?hash=item2202c7725c:g:yKwAAOSwKJVlEHAN">2020 Panini Mosaic Mosaic Green #206 Jerry Jeudy Denver Broncos</a> at $2.49<br />

<p>The PSA 10 grade significantly increases the value of the card compared to ungraded versions. The exact match at $14.00 provides a strong baseline for the value. However, considering the range of prices for other Jerry Jeudy Mosaic cards and the premium for the PSA 10 grade, a fair estimate for the card's value would be between $12 and $16.</p>
<p>Given this range, I would set the lower portion of the estimated price as follows:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=12</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the PSA 10 grade premium while also considering the current market for similar Jerry Jeudy Mosaic cards.

<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, it appears that the price for this card varies somewhat, but there are several comparable listings we can use to establish a fair value estimate.</p>
<p>The most relevant listings include:</p>

<p>Considering these listings, a fair value estimate for the 2020 Panini Clear Vision Jalen Hurts RC Eagles rookie card would be in the range of $5 to $8. The lower end of this range seems to be more common, so I would estimate the fair value to be around $5 to $6.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=5</p>
<p>It's worth noting that prices can fluctuate based on factors such as the card's condition, market demand, and Jalen Hurts' performance. As always, the actual value may vary, and individual sales can occur both above and below this estimated range.

<p>Tyler Johnson was a rookie in 2020, so we'll focus on 2020 Obsidian rookie cards with similar print runs (/75) for comparison.</p>

<p>Tyler Johnson, while a promising rookie, didn't have as high a profile as players like Chase Young or JK Dobbins. However, his card is likely more valuable than less prominent rookies.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Tyler Johnson Buccaneers /75" card to be in the range of $10 to $20.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=10</p>
<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the range, as requested. The actual value could be higher depending on factors such as the card's condition, specific design features, and current market demand for Tyler Johnson cards.

<p>These cards appear to be the same or very similar to the one in question. The prices range from $8.00 to $15.00, with an average of about $11.00.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that there's also a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/224425403422?hash=item3440cbe41e:g:THkAAOSwp-lgd2Ly">2020 Panini Mosaic Pink Camo Jacob Eason RC prism</a> priced at $15.00, but this is likely a special variant and not directly comparable to the base rookie card.</p>
<p>Considering these prices and the general market for rookie cards of quarterbacks who aren't top-tier stars, I would estimate the fair value of the Jacob Eason rookie Colts football card to be in the range of $8 to $12.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=8</p>
<p>The lower end of this range ($8) is set as the PRICE_RESPONSE, as it represents a conservative estimate of the card's value based on the available data. Keep in mind that the actual value can fluctuate based on factors such as the card's condition, the current demand for Jacob Eason cards, and overall market trends in football card collecting.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the fair value of the "2 PSA 10 GRADE CLYDE EDWARDS-HELAIRE ROOKIE CARDS".</p>
<p>Looking at the relevant comparisons in the list, we can see several Clyde Edwards-Helaire rookie cards graded PSA 10:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225163993750?hash=item346cd1e296:g:ulUAAOSw8KtjIqHR">2020 Panini Mosaic Clyde Edwards-Helaire Rookie Card RC #212 PSA 10 CHIEFS 🏈🔥</a> priced at $39.99<br />

<p>There's also a listing for two PSA 10 Clyde Edwards-Helaire rookie cards:<br />
<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/175153780120?hash=item28c7fa9598:g:YYUAAOSw6tNiBpfR">(2) CLYDE EDWARDS-HELAIRE 2020 PANINI MOSAIC #212 RC ROOKIE PSA 10 LOT</a> priced at $45.00</p>
<p>Given that the product in question is for two PSA 10 graded Clyde Edwards-Helaire rookie cards, the most relevant comparison is the last one mentioned. However, considering the range of prices for individual cards, I would estimate the fair value for two PSA 10 Clyde Edwards-Helaire rookie cards to be between $40 and $60.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=40</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the lower end of the range, considering that some individual cards are priced as low as $20-$30, while also factoring in the slight discount that often comes with buying multiple cards together.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Chronicles DP Jonathan Taylor RC #10 Indianapolis Colts PSA 10 card.</p>
<p>First, it's important to note that the PSA 10 grade significantly increases the value of this card compared to ungraded or lower-graded versions. Most of the cards in the COMPARE_ARRAY are ungraded or have lower grades, so we need to account for this difference.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparison in the list is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/145689817479?hash=item21ebca3187:g:77kAAOSwZUVmA54l">2020 CHRONICLES JONATHAN TAYLOR FOOTBALL ROOKIE CARD</a>, which is priced at $2.49. However, this is likely an ungraded version.</p>
<p>We can also look at other high-grade rookie cards from the same set for context:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/375280644417?hash=item5760783141:g:mlUAAOSwt7Nl3kQJ">PSA 8 Joe Burrow rookie</a> is priced at $39.99<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/405107813242?hash=item5e524eab7a:g:rykAAOSwShBmmAzD">PSA 10 Jerry Jeudy rookie</a> is priced at $25.00<br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/265922801564?hash=item3dea3bef9c:g:ASgAAOSwqMZjP3iW">PSA 10 Chase Young rookie</a> is priced at $49.99</p>
<p>Considering that Jonathan Taylor has become a star player and that this card is graded PSA 10, we can estimate that its value would be higher than the Jerry Jeudy PSA 10 and potentially close to or slightly above the Chase Young PSA 10.</p>
<p>Taking all of this into account, a fair estimate for the value of the 2020 Panini Chronicles DP Jonathan Taylor RC #10 Indianapolis Colts PSA 10 would be in the range of $50 to $75.</p>

<p>The lower end of this range ($50) is set as the PRICE_RESPONSE, as it represents a conservative estimate based on the available data. The actual market value could be higher, potentially up to $80 or more, depending on current market conditions and demand for this specific card.

                        Based on the provided COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the CeeDee Lamb Select Rookie RC Dallas Cowboys Football Card. Several relevant listings for this specific card are present in the array, which allows for a good comparison.</p>
<p>The most relevant listings for this card are:</p>

<p>There are also a few listings at $20.00, but these seem to be outliers compared to the majority of the listings.</p>
<p>Based on these comparable listings, I would estimate the fair value of the CeeDee Lamb Select Rookie RC Dallas Cowboys Football Card to be in the range of $4.00 to $7.00. The lower end of this range seems to be more common, so I'll set the estimated value at the lower end.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=4.00</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the most frequent prices seen in the comparable listings while acknowledging that some cards are priced slightly higher. The $4.00 price point represents a conservative estimate that aligns with several of the lower-priced listings for this specific card.

<p>Without more specific information about the exact card (such as the manufacturer or set), it's difficult to determine which of these is the closest match. However, based on the frequency of the $6.00 price point for Herbert rookie cards from the 2020 Absolute set, it seems that this might be a fair baseline value for a common Herbert rookie card.</p>
<p>The Prizm card at $20.00 suggests that some Herbert rookie cards can command higher prices, possibly due to the popularity of the Prizm brand or other factors like condition or scarcity.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Justin Herbert RC Chargers" card to be in the range of $6.00 to $15.00, depending on the specific product and its condition. </p>
<p>To err on the conservative side, I'll set the lower end of this range as the estimated value.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the "ROOKIE Jalen Hurts NFL Debut Football" card.</p>
<p>The most relevant cards in the comparison list are the 2020 Panini Mosaic Jalen Hurts NFL Debut cards, as they appear to be the same or very similar to the card in question. The prices for these cards vary quite a bit, likely due to differences in condition or specific variations (such as parallels or prizms).</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of some relevant comparisons:</p>

<p>Ignoring the outliers (very low and very high prices), it seems that the fair market value for this card is likely between $9 and $15. The variation in price could be due to factors such as card condition, seller reputation, or specific card variations that aren't clear from the title alone.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Jalen Hurts NFL Debut Football" card to be around $10 to $15, with $10 being on the lower end of that range.</p>

<p>The prices for this card seem to range from about $1.25 to $4.50, with most falling in the $2.50 to $4.00 range. Some listings with higher prices (like $11.99 or $20.00) appear to be outliers or possibly graded versions, which would command a premium.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of this Jonathan Taylor Rookie of the Year card to be between $2.50 and $4.00. </p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=2.50</p>
<p>This estimate represents the lower end of the fair value range, as requested. It's worth noting that the actual market value can fluctuate based on factors such as the card's condition, current demand, and any special variations (like parallel versions or autographs) that may not be specified in the product title.

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE CeeDee Lamb RC Panini Chronicles Pink Football Card Dallas Cowboys" card.</p>
<p>The card in question is a pink rookie card of CeeDee Lamb from the 2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance set. Several comparable cards are present in the COMPARE_ARRAY, with prices ranging from about $1 to $6 for non-graded cards. The pink variant seems to be slightly more valuable than the base version.</p>
<p>Some relevant comparisons include:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/134426417530?hash=item1f4c70597a:g:j3kAAOSwt2tj0vyH">2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance CeeDee Lamb PINK Rookie Card RC #206 Cowboys</a> priced at $1.99<br />

4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335550326821?hash=item4e205ba825:g:OhgAAOSwCNRmzjVM">CeeDee Lamb 2020 Panini Chronicles Luminous Pink #206 Dallas COWBOYS Rookie RC</a> priced at $5.00</p>
<p>Based on these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of the card to be in the range of $2.50 to $5.00. The lower end of this range seems more common, so I'll set the estimated value at the lower end.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=2.50</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the condition of the card can significantly impact its value. If the card is in near-mint or better condition, it could command a price closer to the higher end of the range. Additionally, if the card were to be professionally graded and receive a high grade, its value could increase substantially, as evidenced by <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/334438240142?hash=item4dde128f8e:g:3TYAAOSwnqlifFsF">2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance #206 CeeDee Lamb Pink Rookie SGC 10 Gem Mint</a> priced at $50.00. However, for an ungraded card, the lower estimate is more appropriate.

                        Based on the provided COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Chase Young RC Washington Star" card. Several relevant listings for Chase Young rookie cards from the 2020 Panini Absolute set are present in the array.</p>
<p>The prices for Chase Young rookie cards from this set vary, but most fall within the $1 to $5 range. Here are some notable examples:</p>

<p>Considering these prices and the fact that the product title doesn't mention any special attributes (like being graded or in mint condition), I would estimate the fair value of this Chase Young rookie card to be in the range of $1.50 to $3.50.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=1.50</p>
<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the price range observed in the comparable listings. The actual value could be higher depending on the card's condition and any special attributes not mentioned in the title.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the value of the Justin Herbert Score Rookie RC Chargers card. However, it's important to note that the cards in the comparison array are mostly from the 2021 Score set, which would be Herbert's second-year cards, not his rookie cards.</p>
<p>For a true rookie card of Justin Herbert from the Score set, we would expect it to be from the 2020 set and potentially carry a higher value than the second-year cards listed here. Nevertheless, I can provide an estimate based on the available data.</p>
<p>The prices for the 2021 Justin Herbert Score cards (his second year) range from $0.99 to $4.99 for base cards, with some special parallels or graded versions going higher. For example:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/384401829934?hash=item598022702e:g:wkAAAOSw96BhPN6s">2021 Score Football Justin Herbert #233</a> is priced at $0.99<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/402913061867?hash=item5dcf7d6beb:g:PR8AAOSwaZFgwncS">2021 Panini Score NFL Football Justin Herbert #233</a> is priced at $2.50<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/404408491902?hash=item5e289fdf7e:g:UnkAAOSwu-Rj8tGB">2021 Score Justin Herbert, Card # 233</a> is priced at $4.99</p>
<p>Given that the card in question is a rookie card, which typically carries a premium over second-year cards, we can estimate that it would be valued higher than these examples. A conservative estimate for a Justin Herbert Score Rookie RC would likely start around $10 to $15, potentially going higher depending on condition and specific variant.</p>
<p>However, without seeing the exact card or knowing its year and condition, it's difficult to provide a precise valuation. The value could potentially be higher if it's a rare parallel or in mint condition.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this exercise, I'll set the lower end of the estimated range as the PRICE_RESPONSE.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=10</p>
<p>Please note that this is a rough estimate based on the limited information provided, and the actual value could vary depending on factors such as condition, specific variant, and current market demand.

<div class="card card-body">
                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the fair value of the Cam Akers rookie card lot. Let's analyze the relevant comparisons:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/145673965788?hash=item21ead850dc:g:0XkAAOSwUg5l7Aka">2020 Panini Donruss Football The Rookies Cam Akers Rookie Insert Card</a> is priced at $1.00. This is for a single card, not a lot.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/124578986889?hash=item1d017c7b89:g:GhMAAOSwTxxgLhlz">2020 DONRUSS OPTIC CAM AKERS RATED ROOKIE #175 ROOKIE CARD RC LOS ANGELES RAMS</a> is priced at $16.49. This is for a single Optic card, which is typically more valuable than regular Donruss.</p>
<p>These two listings provide a good range for Cam Akers rookie cards from the 2020 Donruss set. However, our product is a 2-card lot, which includes a refractor, potentially increasing its value.</p>
<p>Other rookie cards from the same set and year for players of similar status are priced as follows:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/392985347318?hash=item5b7fc084f6:g:5BkAAOSwLwhfjjva">Tee Higgins rookie card</a> at $3.00<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264870278429?hash=item3dab7fb51d:g:UNsAAOSwTgJfZY0d">Clyde Edwards-Helaire rookie card</a> at $2.99<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/355001331226?hash=item52a7ba6e1a:g:VMEAAOSwLJdk6gGl">Jonathan Taylor rookie card</a> at $2.99</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Cam Akers 2-card lot to be in the range of $5 to $8. The refractor card adds some value, but Akers isn't considered a top-tier player like some others in the set.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=5</p>
<p>To summarize, I estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Cam Akers 2 Card Lot RC 2020 Panini Donruss Refractor Rams Football Card" to be around $5, which is the lower end of the estimated range. This takes into account the fact that it's a 2-card lot including a refractor, balanced against Akers' relative status among rookies from that year.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the Thorgan Hazard 2020 Topps Museum 34/50 card. While there isn't an exact match for this card in the comparison list, we can use similar cards to estimate its value.</p>
<p>The key factors to consider are:<br />
1. It's a Topps Museum card<br />
2. It's numbered to 50<br />
3. Thorgan Hazard is a good player, but not a superstar</p>
<p>Looking at comparable cards:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/175979198419?hash=item28f92d77d3:g:R~UAAOSwurFlNIBo">2019-20 Topps Champions League Museum Gold Card :Dani Parejo #18/50</a> is priced at $15.00. This is a similar numbered card (/50) for a player of comparable status.</p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/194703072581?hash=item2d55351d45:g:YPIAAOSwDvBh1LGn">2020 Museum Jadon Sancho SP Bronze Card 01/99</a> is priced at $34.99. Sancho is a more high-profile player than Hazard, and this card is numbered to 99 instead of 50.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/233777642807?hash=item366e3bbd37:g:Ki4AAOSwNDNfrC7e">2019-20 Topps Museum Collection UEFA Copper FABIAN RUIZ SSC Napoli 63/99</a> is priced at $10.00. This is a similar Museum card, but numbered to 99 and for a less well-known player.</p>
<p>Considering these comparisons, I would estimate the value of the Thorgan Hazard card to be in the range of $15 to $25. The lower numbering (/50) adds value compared to the /99 cards, but Hazard isn't as high-profile as someone like Sancho.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=15</p>
<p>Given the information available, I estimate the fair value of the Thorgan Hazard 2020 Topps Museum 34/50 Borussia Dortmund Belgium card to be around $15, which represents the lower end of the estimated range.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE 2020 Panini Luminance Jalen Hurts RC Eagles GOAT" card. </p>
<p>The cards in the COMPARE_ARRAY are highly relevant as they are all Jalen Hurts rookie cards from the 2020 Panini Chronicles Luminance set, which matches the card in question. The prices for these cards vary significantly based on factors such as condition, specific parallel versions, and grading.</p>
<p>For a base rookie card of Jalen Hurts from this set, the prices generally range from about $1.25 to $9.92. For example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/387274498609?hash=item5a2b5be231:g:msgAAOSwtshmtAR5">this card</a> is priced at $1.25, while <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/305306456857?hash=item4715aed319:g:WcMAAOSwOMdlc3p0">this one</a> is priced at $9.92.</p>
<p>Graded cards in gem mint condition (PSA 10 or equivalent) are priced much higher, ranging from about $34 to $50. For instance, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/145871438100?hash=item21f69d8114:g:gvkAAOSwJ4FmhwIH">this PSA 10 graded card</a> is priced at $34.00.</p>
<p>Special parallel versions, such as colored variants or low-numbered cards, can command even higher prices. For example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276030638941?hash=item4044b54b5d:g:HB8AAOSwOrdkoKKq">this Purple parallel numbered to 49</a> is priced at $150.00.</p>
<p>Given that the PRODUCT_TITLE doesn't mention any special parallels or grading, and assuming it's in good but ungraded condition, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be on the lower end of the range for base cards, around $3 to $6.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=3.00</p>
<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the price range for similar ungraded base cards in the COMPARE_ARRAY. The "GOAT" mention in the title is likely just seller hype and doesn't significantly impact the card's value. However, if the card is in particularly good condition or has any special characteristics not mentioned in the title, its value could be higher within the mentioned range.

<p>After analyzing the comparable cards, I can provide an estimate for the value of this rookie card. The prices for Joe Burrow's 2020 Panini Chronicles rookie cards range from about $2.99 to $29.99, with most falling in the $3-$10 range.</p>
<p>The base versions of the card, such as <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/156383559281?hash=item24692fbe71:g:k3wAAOSwaq9m02kT">2020 Panini Chronicles #19 Joe Burrow Cincinnati Bengals RC</a>, are typically priced around $2.99 to $5.00.

<p>Given that the PRODUCT_TITLE doesn't specify any special parallel or variation, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be on the lower end of the range, likely between $3 and $5.</p>

This card appears to be very similar, if not identical, to the one we're evaluating.</p>
<p>Other rookie patch cards from the same era and similar product lines provide additional context:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276376867399?hash=item4059585247:g:m-gAAOSw9L5lX11X">Jacob Eason RC Patch #RJ-JE /199</a> - $2.95<br />

<p>Most of these cards are priced between $3 and $10, with Denzel Mims' card being on the higher end of this range. This suggests that Mims was considered a more desirable rookie at the time.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Denzel Mims ROOKIE RC Patch Jets card to be in the range of $8 to $12, with $9.99 being a reasonable price point given the direct comparison available.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Raekwon Davis RC AUTO Prizm Miami" card. After analyzing the relevant listings, here's my assessment:</p>
<p>The card in question appears to be a Raekwon Davis rookie autograph card from the 2020 Panini Prizm set. There are several comparable cards in the list, with varying prices depending on the specific parallel or color variant.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparable cards include:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/115939289836?hash=item1afe852aec:g:FfoAAOSwRcJlJeUy">2020 Panini Prizm Rookie Pink Prizm Auto Raekwon Davis #341 Rookie Auto RC (1)</a> at $5.60<br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/166890533850?hash=item26db7373da:g:zTUAAOSwpDdkiM9B">Raekwon Davis Silver AUTO RC 2020 Panini Prizm</a> at $7.88<br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/325988042412?hash=item4be666c6ac:g:9mYAAOSwp91luZox">2020 Panini Prizm Rookie Autographs Silver #341 Raekwon Davis RC AUTO DOLPHINS</a> at $6.00</p>
<p>These base autograph versions provide a good baseline for the card's value. There are also some slightly higher-priced variants, such as:</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/274897747842?hash=item40012ebf82:g:kM8AAOSwOL9hENzN">2020 Panini Prizm Raekwon Davis Red Wave Auto Rookie Card /149</a> at $9.99<br />
5. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/404074259157?hash=item5e14b3e2d5:g:MLsAAOSwrBBjVtym">RAEKWON DAVIS 2020 Panini Prizm AUTO Green Pulsar AUTOGRAPH Card #341 DOLPHINS</a> at $12.95</p>
<p>Considering these prices and the fact that some listings are priced lower (likely due to market fluctuations or seller urgency), I would estimate the fair value of the card to be in the range of $5 to $8.</p>
<p>Given this range, I'll set the lower portion of the estimated price as:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=5.00</p>
<p>This estimate reflects the lower end of the fair market value for a standard Raekwon Davis rookie autograph Prizm card. The actual value could be slightly higher depending on the specific parallel or condition of the card, but $5.00 represents a conservative baseline for this rookie autograph card.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the "ROOKIE Jalen Hurts RC Eagles" card.</p>
<p>The majority of the relevant cards in the list are from the 2020 Panini Absolute set, which appears to be the most common and comparable set for this rookie card. Let's analyze the prices:</p>
<p>1. Base rookie cards of Jalen Hurts from this set range from about $3 to $8, with most falling in the $3-$5 range. For example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/375344185518?hash=item576441c0ae:g:kQ8AAOSwMexlb6z4">JALEN HURTS 2020 Panini Absolute Football Rookie Card RC #145</a> is priced at $3.99.</p>
<p>2. There are some graded cards with higher prices, such as <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296412893271?hash=item450395d057:g:7FkAAOSwf6dmN-3m">2020 Panini Absolute Football Jalen Hurts RC #145 PSA 10 GEM MT</a> at $59.99, but these are not directly comparable to an ungraded card.</p>
<p>3. Some slightly higher-priced raw cards, like <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/233912197524?hash=item367640e194:g:zpcAAOSwcTJgOb7J">2020 Jalen Hurts Panini Absolute Rookie #145 RC MINT Very Nice 🔥🔥🔥 QTY</a> at $16.95, may be in better condition or from sellers with higher reputations.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, a fair estimate for the value of a raw "ROOKIE Jalen Hurts RC Eagles" card from the 2020 Panini Absolute set would be in the range of $3 to $8, depending on its condition and the specific variant (base, green, red, etc.).</p>
<p>To be conservative and account for potential condition issues or market fluctuations, I would estimate the lower end of this range at $3.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=3</p>
<p>This estimate assumes an average condition card. If the card is in pristine condition or a rarer variant, it could be worth more. Conversely, if it's in poor condition, it might be worth less. Always consider having valuable cards professionally graded to maximize their value.

                        Based on the provided COMPARE_ARRAY, I can estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Absolute Chase Claypool RC #116 Pittsburgh Steelers PSA 10 card. Let's analyze the relevant listings:</p>

<p>These listings are the most relevant as they match the exact card, player, year, and PSA 10 grade. The prices range from $19.99 to $31.49, with most falling between $20 and $30.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of the card to be in the range of $20 to $30, with the lower end of that range being more common.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=20</p>
<p>It's worth noting that there are a few outliers in the data:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/354068931794?hash=item52702724d2:g:m8YAAOSwKV9ihuvL">2020 Panini Absolute Chase Claypool Rookie Card PSA 10 GEM MT #116 RC Steelers</a> - $49.95<br />
<a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/404763557126?hash=item5e3dc9bd06:g:GY8AAOSwfXBls0q~">Chase Claypool 2020 Panini Absolute Chrome Foil Steelers Rookie #116 RC PSA 10</a> - $59.95</p>
<p>These higher-priced listings may be for special variations or from sellers hoping for a premium, but they don't seem representative of the typical market value for this card.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while you might be able to sell the card for more to the right buyer, a fair market value estimate would be around $20 to $25, with $20 being a conservative starting point.

The most relevant cards for comparison are the 2020 Panini Mosaic Jordan Love rookie cards, as they appear to be the same or very similar to the card in question.</p>
<p>Looking at the prices of these cards, we can see a range from about $5 to $21 for ungraded cards. Some notable examples include:</p>

<p>There are also some higher-priced graded cards, but these are not directly comparable to an ungraded card.</p>
<p>Considering the range of prices and the frequency of listings, a fair estimate for the value of this Jordan Love rookie card would be between $7 and $12. The lower end of this range seems more common, so I would lean towards the lower part of this estimate.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=7</p>
<p>This estimate of $7 represents the lower portion of the fair value range for this card based on the provided data. Keep in mind that card conditions, market fluctuations, and individual seller practices can affect the actual selling price.

<p>Looking at the relevant comparable cards, we have:</p>

<p>The Orange Laser Prizm is a specific parallel that's typically more valuable than the base Prizm. However, the prices for Jonathan Taylor cards vary significantly in the provided list.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of the Jonathan Taylor Panini Prizm RC Mint Orange Laser Prizm Rookie PSA 10 to be in the range of $80 to $120.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=80</p>
<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the range, taking into account the specific Orange Laser Prizm parallel and the PSA 10 grade, which adds significant value. The wide price range in the comparable sales suggests some volatility in the market for this card, so the actual market price could fluctuate within or even outside this range depending on current demand and availability.

<p>The most relevant comparisons from the list are:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296029818892?hash=item44ecc0900c:g:iCgAAOSw-o9lSVWg">2020 Leaf Draft Justin Herbert Gold PSA 9 Rookie RC</a> priced at $17.50<br />

3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/387439713425?hash=item5a3534dc91:g:f1oAAOSwArBmsPwz">-Rare- 2020 -JUSTIN HERBERT- PSA 9 Leaf Draft GOLD Rookie Football Card - RC</a> priced at $24.99</p>
<p>These cards are the most similar to the one in question, all being PSA 9 graded Gold Justin Herbert Leaf Draft rookies from 2020. The prices range from $17.50 to $29.97.</p>
<p>Considering that the card in question is described as having a "LOW POP" (low population), which suggests it might be somewhat rarer, I would estimate its fair value to be on the higher end of this range.</p>
<p>My estimate for the fair value of this card would be between $25 and $30.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=25</p>
<p>It's worth noting that prices can fluctuate based on market conditions, the player's performance, and other factors. Additionally, the "LOW POP" designation, if accurate, could potentially increase the value slightly above this range for the right buyer.

<p>Considering these prices and the fact that the card in question is a PSA 8 (which is lower than PSA 9 or 10), and taking into account the special feature of the card number matching the jersey number, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be between $15 and $25.</p>
<p>The PSA 8 grade puts it below the value of the PSA 10 card, but above the ungraded cards. The matching card number and jersey number add some uniqueness and value. The low population (POP 10) also adds to its rarity and value.</p>
<p>Given these factors, I would estimate the lower end of the fair value range to be around $15.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I'll analyze the relevant football cards to estimate a fair value for the "ROOKIE Van Jefferson Prizm Patch Rams" card.</p>
<p>Several cards in the list are directly comparable to the card in question:</p>

<p>There are also some pink versions of the card, which tend to be priced slightly higher, but we'll focus on the standard silver versions as they seem more relevant to the card in question.</p>
<p>Considering these prices, it appears that the value of the Van Jefferson Prizm Rookie Patch card varies quite a bit, ranging from about $3 to $17. The majority of the prices, however, fall in the $3-$10 range.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Van Jefferson Prizm Patch Rams" card to be between $5 and $10. The lower end of this range seems more common, so I'll set the PRICE_RESPONSE to the lower portion of this estimate.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=5.00</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the varying conditions and slight differences in the cards listed, as well as the overall market for Van Jefferson rookie cards. It's worth noting that prices can fluctuate based on factors such as the player's performance, market demand, and the specific condition of individual cards.

<p>This estimate takes into account the various prices seen for similar cards, with some consideration for potential variations in condition or specific details of the card that weren't provided in the product title.

<p>These cards are the most relevant to the one we're evaluating. The prices range from $2.99 to $13.50, with most falling in the lower end of that range. The $13.50 card seems to be an outlier, possibly due to a specific parallel or condition.</p>
<p>Considering these prices and the fact that the card in question is described as a rookie card (RC), which typically holds more value, I would estimate the fair value of the "ROOKIE Michael Pittman Jr. RC Colts" card to be in the range of $3.50 to $5.00.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=3.50</p>
<p>This estimate is based on the lower end of the range, as requested. The actual value could be higher depending on factors such as the specific set, condition, and any special features (like parallels or autographs) that aren't mentioned in the title.

<p>Considering the consistency of pricing across multiple listings, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be around $1.50. This price point represents the lower end of the common price range, which is a reasonable estimate for the card's value.</p>

                        Based on the provided COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the "Chase Claypool rookie refactor" card. While the exact "refactor" variant isn't present in the list, we can use the prices of similar Chase Claypool rookie cards from the 2020 Donruss Optic set to estimate its value.</p>
<p>Several relevant cards from the list include:</p>

<p>The prices for Chase Claypool rookie cards from this set range from about $5 to $19, depending on the specific variant (color, prizm type, etc.). Without knowing the exact details of the "refactor" variant, I would estimate the value to be in the middle to lower end of this range.</p>
<p>A fair estimate for the "Chase Claypool rookie refactor" card would be between $6 and $12. To be conservative, I'll set the lower end of this range as the estimate.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=6</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the actual value could vary based on the specific characteristics of the "refactor" variant, the card's condition, and current market trends. For a more accurate valuation, it would be helpful to know more details about the specific "refactor" variant and to see recent sales data for that exact card.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the value of the "ROOKIE Joe Burrow Bagels and Tua Tagovailoa Dual RC" card.</p>
<p>The title in question appears to be a dual rookie card featuring Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa, which is similar to many of the cards listed in the COMPARE_ARRAY. Most of these cards are from the 2020 Panini Contenders set, specifically the "Round Numbers" subset featuring both players.</p>
<p>While the exact card mentioned in PRODUCT_TITLE isn't present in the list, we can use the similar cards to estimate its value. The prices for these similar cards vary quite a bit, ranging from about $4 to $15 for ungraded cards, with higher prices for graded or special versions.</p>
<p>Some relevant examples include:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/235105754584?hash=item36bd651dd8:g:P6AAAOSw4EVkIqeT">Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa 2020 Panini Contenders Round Numbers Rookie RC</a> priced at $13.00</p>

<p>Based on these comparisons, I would estimate the fair value of the card in question to be in the range of $8 to $15, depending on its condition and any special features it might have.</p>
<p>To provide a specific estimate at the lower end of this range:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=8.00</p>
<p>This estimate assumes the card is in good condition but ungraded. If the card has any special features (like being autographed or a limited edition), or if it's from a more premium set than the Contenders series, its value could be significantly higher.

<p>After analyzing the comparable sales, it appears that D'Andre Swift's PSA 10 rookie cards from the 2020 Panini Prizm set have a range of values. We can see several relevant listings:</p>

<p>These listings provide a good baseline for the card's value. However, it's worth noting that there are also some outliers in the data:</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225176891163?hash=item346d96af1b:g:ZqIAAOSwynpjLzVZ">2020 Panini Prizm Rookie D'Andre Swift #358.1 PSA 10 GEM MT Rookie RC</a> priced at $199.95<br />

<p>These higher-priced listings seem to be outliers and may not represent the typical market value for this card.</p>
<p>Considering the most consistent pricing data, I would estimate the fair value of the 2020 Panini Prizm RC D'Andre Swift #358 Detroit Lions PSA 10 to be in the range of $35 to $55.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=35</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the lower end of the price range, which seems to be the most common price point for this card in PSA 10 condition. The higher-priced listings may be from sellers hoping for a premium, but they don't seem to reflect the general market value based on the majority of the listings provided.

<p>The most relevant comparisons are:</p>

<p>The key difference is that the card in question is graded PSA 10 Gem Mint, which significantly increases its value. Additionally, it's noted as "Pop 1," meaning it's the only one of its kind graded at this level.</p>
<p>Other relevant information:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386732895937?hash=item5a0b13aec1:g:JA0AAOSw4VBlu-xM">2023 Panini Mosaic Jake Moody RC Red Mosaic Color Match</a> - $8.00 (different color, but shows demand for special versions)<br />

<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of this PSA 10 Gem Mint Pop 1 Jake Moody Green Mosaic rookie card to be in the range of $40 to $60. The PSA 10 grade and Pop 1 status significantly increase its value compared to raw cards or lower grades.</p>

<p>Considering these comparable cards, a fair estimate for the value of the Tua Tagovailoa 2020 Panini Mosaic #203 Rookie Pink Camo PSA 10 GEM MT Dolphins card would be in the range of $70 to $130.</p>

<p>After analyzing the relevant listings, it appears that the card you're inquiring about is a popular Joe Burrow rookie card from the 2020 Panini Chronicles set, specifically the Clearly Donruss subset. This card is highly sought after by collectors due to its unique clear acetate design and Joe Burrow's rising star status.</p>
<p>The prices for this card vary based on condition and whether it's graded or raw (ungraded). Here's a breakdown of some relevant listings:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/304349045289?hash=item46dc9de229:g:xeUAAOSwD1FiAY43">Raw (ungraded) cards range from $15.00 to $55.00</a><br />
2. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/374330324699?hash=item5727d376db:g:aDcAAOSwhAJjXC-T">PSA 9 graded copy is listed at $29.99</a><br />
3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/267003622543?hash=item3e2aa7f48f:g:QS8AAOSwmXVm84qm">PSA 10 graded copy is listed at $144.55</a></p>
<p>For a raw, ungraded copy in good condition, the fair market value seems to be in the range of $30 to $40. Some listings are priced higher, while others are lower, likely depending on the condition and seller's pricing strategy.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of an ungraded 2020 Chronicles Joe Burrow Clearly Donruss Rated Rookie card to be around $30 to $40, with $30 being on the lower end of the range for average condition cards.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=30</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the actual value can fluctuate based on the card's condition, market demand, and Joe Burrow's performance on the field. If the card is in pristine condition, it could command a higher price, potentially closer to the upper end of the range or even more if professionally graded.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of the Tua Tagovailoa signed 2020 Select Prizm White Die Cut RC PSA Grade 10 card.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparison is <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315430409254?hash=item49711e1426:g:SUMAAOSw1gRmZ6iC">Tua Tagovailoa Signed 2020 Select Prizm White Die Cut #245 RC PSA Grade 10</a>, which is listed at $349.99. This is an exact match for the card in question, including the signature and PSA 10 grade.</p>
<p>Other relevant comparisons include:</p>

<p>Considering these comparisons, the signed white die-cut PSA 10 card appears to be the most valuable. The exact match at $349.99 provides a strong baseline for the card's value. However, it's worth noting that signed cards can vary in value depending on the quality and authenticity of the signature.</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of the Tua Tagovailoa Signed 2020 Select Prizm White Die Cut #245 RC PSA Grade 10 to be in the range of $300 to $400.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I'll analyze the relevant football card listings to estimate a fair value for the "2020 Los Angeles Rams 12 Card ROOKIE RC Lot Cam Akers - Super Bowl LVI 2022" product.</p>
<p>The most relevant listings from the COMPARE_ARRAY are:</p>

<p>The Cam Akers listings are particularly relevant since he's specifically mentioned in the product title. However, the 12-card lot we're evaluating likely includes other Rams rookies from 2020 as well.</p>
<p>Considering these comparable listings, we can estimate that a 12-card rookie lot for the 2020 Rams, including Cam Akers, would likely be valued between $15 and $25. The lower end of this range takes into account the more common rookie cards, while the higher end considers the potential inclusion of some higher-value cards or variations.</p>
<p>Given this analysis, I would estimate the fair value of the "2020 Los Angeles Rams 12 Card ROOKIE RC Lot Cam Akers - Super Bowl LVI 2022" to be around $15 to $25, with $15 being the lower end of the range.</p>

<div class="card card-body">
                        Based on the provided list of Joe Burrow rookie cards, specifically the Turbocharged variant from the 2020 Select Football set, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of the card. The prices vary significantly depending on the condition and whether the card is graded or not.</p>
<p>For ungraded cards:<br />
The prices range from about $5 to $30, with most falling in the $10-$20 range. For example, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315509548589?hash=item4975d5a62d:g:SAgAAOSwn6BmhbAT">an ungraded card is listed for $5.00</a>, while <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/385381238400?hash=item59ba830680:g:kSwAAOSwaTNj1yni">another is listed for $12.99</a>.</p>
<p>For graded cards:<br />
PSA 10 (Gem Mint) condition cards are generally the most valuable, with prices ranging from about $35 to $125. For instance, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335539620320?hash=item4e1fb849e0:g:sUQAAOSwY-1mxWyg">a PSA 10 graded card is listed for $35.00</a>, while <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/186296378748?hash=item2b6021257c:g:W8YAAOSwh~llyaoH">another PSA 10 is listed for $125.00</a>.</p>
<p>PSA 9 (Mint) condition cards are slightly less valuable, with prices around $30-$55. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/226331607227?hash=item34b26a40bb:g:VqsAAOSwfNJm134b">A PSA 9 graded card is listed for $34.99</a>.</p>
<p>There are also some special variants, like the Silver Prizm, which command higher prices. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/134721550374?hash=item1f5e07b826:g:~5MAAOSwaq1k~S0w">A PSA 10 Silver Prizm is listed for $104.90</a>.</p>
<p>Considering all these factors, a fair estimate for a standard Joe Burrow 2020 Select Turbocharged rookie card would be:</p>
<p>1. Ungraded: $10-$20<br />
2. PSA 9: $30-$40<br />
3. PSA 10: $40-$70</p>
<p>For a conservative estimate, I would suggest the lower end of these ranges.</p>

                        Based on the provided information, I can estimate the fair value of the "2020 LEAF DRAFT TUA TAGOVAILOA AUTOGRAPHS PSA 9 AUTO 10 POP 1!!!!" card. Let's analyze the relevant cards from the comparison list:</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/395718558485?hash=item5c22aa0315:g:J8IAAOSwRkVm8aU1">2020 LEAF DRAFT TUA TAGOVAILOA AUTOGRAPHS PSA 9 AUTO 10 POP 1 !!!!</a> - This is an exact match, priced at $325.00.</p>

<p>Considering these comparisons, the autographed PSA 9 card with an AUTO 10 grade is significantly more valuable than the non-autographed versions. The exact match in the list is priced at $325.00, which seems reasonable given the autograph and the POP 1 (population 1) status, indicating its rarity.</p>
<p>However, it's worth noting that Leaf cards generally have lower values compared to more premium brands like Panini or Topps. The autograph and the POP 1 status are the main drivers of value for this card.</p>
<p>Taking all factors into account, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be in the range of $275 to $350. The lower end of this range accounts for potential market fluctuations and the fact that Leaf is not the most sought-after brand.</p>

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE 'Brock' and the COMPARE_ARRAY, I'll focus on the Brock Purdy cards, as they are the most relevant to our analysis. Other players' cards will be ignored for this estimation.</p>
<p>After analyzing the relevant Brock Purdy cards, I can provide an estimate for the fair value of a Brock Purdy football card. The prices vary significantly based on factors such as the card's condition (PSA grading), special features (like color variations), and rarity.</p>
<p>For a base Brock Purdy rookie card from the 2022 Panini Prizm set in excellent condition (PSA 10), the price range appears to be between $125 and $225. For example:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/315746984117?hash=item4983fca0b5:g:lA4AAOSwBcZm4cAr">2022 Panini Prizm Brock Purdy #353 49ers Rookie PSA 10 GEM MT</a> is priced at $125.00<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/375094092209?hash=item575559a1b1:g:-MgAAOSwAWtlagqo">2022 Prizm #353 Brock Purdy Rookie PSA 10 GEM MINT SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS QB RC</a> is priced at $225.00</p>
<p>For cards with special features or rare variations, the prices can be significantly higher. For instance:</p>
<p>- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/116023609406?hash=item1b038bc83e:g:ua4AAOSwMWZljnje">2022 Panini Prizm Brock Purdy Silver Prizm Rookie Card RC #353 PSA 9 MINT 49ers</a> is priced at $400.00<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/146078778595?hash=item2202f944e3:g:gGQAAOSw0Spm35LZ">2022 Panini Prizm Brock Purdy Orange Ice Rookie Prizm #353 💎PSA 10 Gem Mint</a> is priced at $574.95</p>
<p>Given this information, I would estimate the fair value of a standard Brock Purdy rookie card from the 2022 Panini Prizm set in excellent condition (PSA 10) to be around $125 to $175. For the purpose of setting PRICE_RESPONSE, I'll use the lower end of this range.</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=125</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the actual value can fluctuate based on market conditions, the player's performance, and other factors. Rare variations or special editions of the card could command significantly higher prices.

                        Based on the provided PRODUCT_TITLE and COMPARE_ARRAY, I can offer an estimate for the value of the Jalen Hurts RC 2020 Panini Phoenix Fire Burst Rookie #144 Philadelphia Eagles card.</p>
<p>The most relevant comparisons are the Jalen Hurts 2020 Phoenix Fire Burst Rookie cards, specifically #114 (which appears to be the correct number, not #144 as in the PRODUCT_TITLE). The prices for these cards vary based on their condition and PSA grading.</p>
<p>For ungraded cards or those with lower grades:<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/204608374340?hash=item2fa39c0644:g:4JEAAOSwO7xlm0ge">2020 Panini Phoenix Base #114 Jalen Hurts (RC) Eagles</a> is priced at $4.99, but this is likely not the Fire Burst version.<br />
- <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335487004772?hash=item4e1c957064:g:VuQAAOSw25dmlKTP">2020 Panini Phoenix - Rookies Fire Burst #114 Jalen Hurts (RC)</a> is priced at $19.99 for an ungraded card.</p>
<p>For PSA 9 graded cards:<br />
- Prices range from $32.95 to $50.00, with most falling in the $35-$40 range.</p>
<p>For PSA 10 graded cards:<br />
- Prices range from $45.00 to $125.00, with most falling in the $70-$90 range.</p>
<p>Given that the PRODUCT_TITLE doesn't mention a PSA grade, we should assume it's ungraded or in a condition that hasn't been professionally assessed. Therefore, a fair estimate for this card would be in the $20-$30 range, considering it's the desirable Fire Burst version but lacks a professional grade.</p>
<p>To provide a specific estimate at the lower end of this range:</p>
<p>PRICE_RESPONSE=20</p>
<p>This estimate takes into account the potential for the card to be in good condition but allows for the uncertainty of its ungraded status. If the card were to be graded and receive a high grade, its value could increase significantly.

<p>3. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/256669082196?var=556992583491&amp;hash=item3bc2ab6254:g:kD4AAOSwSWFnBOMC">2020 Panini NFL Sticker &amp; Card Collection Justin Herbert PSA 9 MINT Rookie RC</a> sold for $114.10. This is a PSA 9, which is a step below the PSA 10 in the title.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/276622139365?hash=item4067f6dfe5:g:3U8AAOSwKZlm1QEK">JUSTIN HERBERT 2020 Panini STICKERS CARDS RC SILVER SP ROOKIE PSA 7 POP 1</a> sold for $199.00. This is also noted as a Pop 1, but it's only a PSA 7.</p>
<p>Given that this card is a PSA 10 and a Pop 1, it should command a significant premium over these comparable sales. The Pop 1 status, in particular, makes it quite rare and desirable for collectors.</p>
<p>Considering these factors, I would estimate the fair value of this card to be in the range of $300 to $400. The Pop 1 status and PSA 10 grade significantly increase its value over the comparable sales we see in the list.</p>
