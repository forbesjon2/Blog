2018: [Binomial stock option pricing script](https://github.com/forbesjon2/binomialOptions2018). Updated in 2021 & 2022 to use TDAmeritrade API

2019: transcript.fm, searchable podcast transcriptions using PostgreSQL full text search. Halted because of legal reasons after being pitched to a new venture competition. Keeping the domain for a future project based on this idea

2018-2020: School social network app. [Github](https://github.com/forbesjon2/MNO), [Demo](https://youtu.be/eT0aPIVplrM). And transcript.fm (podcast transcript search engine) project that was halted due to potential legal issues.

2020-2021: worldcomm ([in TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/M6wpV9nC)). A location based voice chat app written in react-native. [Demo 1](https://youtu.be/ILDwSEABlCs), [Demo 2](https://youtu.be/3YaPptrOQ2E)

2021: [bullionstats](https://bullionstats.net/) (now defunct). Tracks silver inventory & premium trends

2022: Managing a friend's wordpress page

2022-2023: SpliceX ([in macOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splicex/id1658699954?mt=12)). MacOS application for transcribing and splicing audio/video content

Made changes to worldcomm so WebRTC no longer uses plan-b but instead uses the unified plan

2024: 
- SpliceX - Possibly implement new speaker diarization algorithm (VGGish + clustering algorithm?). Continue to use this on a video project. Fix bugs & add features as needed.
- Guitar - Play guitar more & make a guitar/drum/bass cover of a few songs.
- Worldcomm - (temporarily on hold) Make one more update regarding share-ability before you get into ad campaigns. Added app usage tracking

Current: Re-learning pytorch based on small projects, writing ideas for SpliceX improvements based on real project experience, research police radio app last touched in 2022 to see if it's reasonable to continue its development
